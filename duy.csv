AB Aviation,9,"""pretty decent airline""",11th November 2019,True," Moroni to Moheli. Turned out to be a pretty decent airline. Online booking worked well, checkin and boarding was fine and the plane looked well maintained. Its a very short flight - just 20 minutes or so so i didn't expect much but they still managed to hand our a bottle of water and some biscuits which i though was very nice.

AB Aviation,1,"""Not a good airline""",25th June 2019,True,"Moroni to Anjouan. It is a very small airline. My ticket advised me to turn up at 0800hrs which I did. There was confusion at this small airport. I was then directed to the office of AB Aviation which was still closed. It opened at 0900hrs and I was told that the flight had been put back to 1300hrs and that they had tried to contact me. This could not be true as they did not have my phone number. I was with a local guide and he had not been informed either. I presume that I was bumped off. The later flight did operate but as usual, there was confusion at check-in. The flight was only 30mins and there were no further problems. Not a good airline but it is the only one for Comoros.",E120,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Moroni to Anjouan,June 2019,1,1,1,1,,,1,no
AB Aviation,1,"""flight was fortunately short""",25th June 2019,True," Anjouan to Dzaoudzi. A very small airline and the only airline based in Comoros. Check-in was disorganised because of locals with big packages and disinterested staff. The flight was fortunately short (30 mins). Took off on time and landed on time.

Adria Airways,1,"""I will never fly again with Adria""",28th September 2019,False," Please do a favor yourself and do not fly with Adria. On the route from Munich to Pristina in July 2019 they lost my luggage and for 10 days in a row, despite numerous phone calls they were not able to locate it. 11 days later the luggage arrived at the destination completely ruined. Applying for compensation, they ignored my request. Foolishly again, I booked another flight with them (345 euros) Frankfurt - Pristina in September 2019. They cancelled the flight with no reason 24 hours before the departure. Desperate phone calls to customer service to get anything (rerouting, compensation, etc) were not responded.

My friend and I should have returned from Sofia to Amsterdam on September 22 and 3 days before, they sent us an SMS informing the flight was cancelled. For 3 straight days we tried to reach the airline and the web agent (e-dreams) and we did not get a solution. Finally, 18 hours before our cancelled flight time, and after 35 minutes on a call (waiting), the airline was able to get us on a flight with Lufthansa. Do not book Adria Airways, it is unreliable and in our case, it ruined our last days of holidays since we needed to be on the phones all day.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sofia to Amsterdam via Ljubljana,September 2019,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Adria Airways,1,"""Had very bad experience""",17th September 2019,True, Had very bad experience with rerouted and cancelled flights last weekend with Adria airways. Original Route was Ljubljana to Sarajevo return. Two weeks before i received an email that the flight was cancelled. Offered route change was Ljubljana to Sarajevo via Munich. Flight back changed to Sarajevo-Pristina-Ljubljana. I accepted. The first flight via Munich was ok. Two hours before the return flight I got the email that the flight was cancelled. I had to rebook via hotline and had to accept a flight with Croatian to Zagreb. I reached Ljubljana 4 h later and had to organize Transport from Zagreb to Ljubljana on my own cost.

Adria Airways,1,"""worse than the budget airlines""",6th September 2019,False," Ljubljana to Zürich. Firstly, Ljubljana airport is terrible. Badly trained staff, unfriendly. Toilets are very dirty. Flight 2 hours delayed without any information. There is no Information desk so questions aren‘t possible. Never again will use this airline. Its even worse than the budget airlines and thats difficult. ",,Business,Economy Class,Ljubljana to Zürich,September 2019,1,1,1,1,,,1,no
Adria Airways,1,"""book another company""",24th August 2019,False," First of all, I am not complaining about a specific flight. I am a Lufthansa frequent Flyer and I normally fly the route Munich - Timisoara. This summer season Lufthansa offered the flights on this route to Adria Airways, as they are a star alliance member. I can only tell that I have the worst experiences with them. In over 90% of the cases they are late, they don't fly on time. Always they offer the same excuse: they have no slot free. This is an unacceptable excuse, as all other companies flying on similar coridors seem not to have this problem. In addition, as LH Cityline was operating these flights I have almost never heard this excuse, or had this problem. I am flying on this route for 6 years already. They started also to cancel some flights. Maybe combine 2 flights into 1 to spare some money, who knows. The cabin crew is decent - not wow, not bad - but there also also situations when the staff are really rude and not customer oriented. I would recommend anyone to fly with this company. If you have the chance, book another company!",Bombardier CRJ,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Timisoara to Munich,August 2019,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Adria Airways,1,"""combined two flights""",6th August 2019,True, Worst Airline ever! They combined two flights to save costs.

Adria Airways,8,"""the crew was nice""",12th October 2018,True,"Ljubljana to Munich. The homebase airport of Adria Airways is Ljubljana and it very small, relaxing and convenient. It is surrounded by the Alps and the departure was fantastic. The airplane was modern and the crew was nice. Ontime departure. Drinks without alcohol were free and I paid 4€ for my white wine. Considering that I had a cheap ticket I cannot complain. Upgrades would have been available for 30€ - which includes the lounge.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ljubljana to Munich,October 2018,1,1,1,1,,,1,yes
Adria Airways,1,"""Very bad experience overall""",5th October 2018,False, Zurich to Ljubljana. Very poor customer service. Flight was cancelled without sending any email confirmation.

Very bad experience overall.,,Business,Economy Class,Zurich to Ljubljana,October 2018,1,1,,1,1,1,1,no
Adria Airways,1,"""bad customer service""",29th July 2018,True," Vienna to Sofia. The flight was delayed by 2 hours. The cabin crew was annoyed that they had to offer drinks to the passengers and passing by announced they would only give one drink per customer. And coffee was a nuisance and they made it clear, even though it was on their cart. The questions would normally go ""would you drink anything?"" and not ""what would you like to drink?"". Very bad customer service.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Vienna to Sofia,July 2018,1,1,1,1,,,1,no
Adria Airways,2,"""overall very poor""",19th July 2018,True," We were traveling from Paris to Skopje on May 4th, via Ljubljana. Our flight from Ljubljana to Skopje, was canceled 10 days before our departure for no reason, leaving us in the middle of our connection at Ljubljana. Even if the company booked a hotel for us and made sure we could take a flight the next day, it prevented us from enjoying one more day in Macedonia. The company had agreed to reimburse the hostel night we had already paid but more than two months after our claim we still have no reply from the company. I e-mailed the company two times, called them on multiple occasion. The company said I would be reimbursed after 2 months. 2 months later, I still have not received anything. The experience with Adria Airways was overall very poor : - flight canceled for no reason - 2 out of 4 of the flights we took were delayed - terrible customer service, unable to give any answer to our online claim and not reimbursing the hostel night we had already paid",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Skopje via Ljubljana,May 2018,1,1,,1,,,1,no
Adria Airways,2,"""Would not fly again""",30th June 2018,True," Ljubljana to Munich. Adria's checkin system is obviously barely coping. It wasn't possible to obtain an electronic boarding pass (iphone wallet version) from Adria's site. The option was there but it failed without any further explanation. Further more I was not able to checkin to return flight online - neither through Adria nor Lufthansa web site. In the end I made it via Lufthansa mobile app. Go figure. Both issues were reported to customer care and both were ignored. I experienced the same customer care ""policy"" couple of years ago when my inquiry with customer support was basically ignored. Flight was actually operated by a Romanian company Carpatair. The cabin was outdated and dirty with a funny smell lingering around. The latter stuck to my clothes for the day - not that great if you are meeting a client. Cabin crew was also quite disorganised and mixed up orders of all passengers sitting around me. Would not fly again. Unfortunately they are the only company offering a direct flight from LJU to MUC.",,Business,Economy Class,Ljubljana to Munich,June 2018,1,1,1,1,,,1,no
Adria Airways,3,"""very unpleasant experience""",24th June 2018,True," A very unpleasant experience for my family. We bought two return flights (Ljubljana-Prague-Ljubljana, Ljubljana-Warsaw-Ljubljana), and several days before departure both direct flights from and to Prague were canceled and a flight to Warsaw was merged with Prague flight (so added necessary stopover). Instead of a direct flight to Prague Adria Airways finally offered a transfer via Munich. When we arrived at the airport (21/6/2018), we found that the flight to Munich had more than an hour of delay, and therefore it was not possible to catch the next flight from Munich to Prague. The flight to Munich was full of people from the original canceled flight to Prague, who subsequently wanted to continue to Prague. Although the Adria Airways staff were present at the airport, no one came to inform the passengers and the result was tremendous confusion and lack of information. Ljubljana airport servicing staff finally informed us that Adria Airways staff refused to come! Also wasn't possible to call the Adria Airways hotline. Maybe it had been overloaded due to the number of disgruntled passengers because the next gate was full of people waiting for a delayed flight to Vienna, where there also wasn't anybody from Adria Airways who could provide any information. Unfortunately this flight left without us and we were all forced to ride from the Munich airport to a more than 30 km distant hotel and the next morning at 6am again back. Permanent cancellation of flights and subsequent ignorance of passengers are surely a way to reduce operating costs, but in the long-term this will cause the outflow of passengers to other airports around Slovenia, especially to Graz and to Zagreb.",A319,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ljubljana to Prague,June 2018,1,1,,1,,,1,no

We were not given any food or water and when I requested some I was told to complain to Adria Airways website. Another plane was organized, more than 2 hrs later. The staff was trying to convince the passengers that their connection to Singapore will wait (they had 15 min in between the new flight arrival time and departure!), and that the flight to Frankfurt is 1 hr - and no wifi connectivity on flight!",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ljubljana to Frankfurt,March 2018,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Adria Airways,3,"""should be ashamed of their operations""",5th December 2017,True," Ljubljana to Vienna. Overall, the flight services of Adria are those of an average, reliable, small European carrier. I have flown them many times over the years, and I have seldom experienced any problems with the flights themselves. Returning to Vienna from a visit to Albania and Slovenia in September, however, I had an encounter with Adria that has revealed just how much their customer service quality could be improved. Adria offers opportunities to purchase business class upgrades or empty economy class seats through Optiontown. Business class upgrades on Adria are a joke because you're paying at least 50EUR for an empty seat next to you and a snack. The option to purchase an empty economy class seat at 19EUR is a great deal though, in my opinion. Having selected this option for my LJU-VIE flight, I received a confirmation that my transaction had cleared and the extra seat had been assigned next to me. Fast forward to the actual flight: there had been an aircraft change from the CRJ-900 to an ATR-72 (Darwin Airlines/Etihad Regional), but I still had my empty seat. The ATR-72 has two seats that face towards the rear of the plane at the front of the cabin, and one of the women seated there was scared to fly backwards, so the flight attendant unilaterally reassigned her to my empty seat without asking. It's a short flight, and I didn't want to cause a scene, so I just let it all happen assuming I could easily get a refund for my 20EUR transaction. It took exactly one month for Adria's customer service team to respond to me, and they said that my ""business class upgrade"" had not cleared, so I was not charged. I had never requested a business class upgrade, and I was charged for the empty seat I had in fact requested, so I sent all of the relevant receipts and statements back to Adria. Three weeks later, I still have yet to receive a response, so I simply disputed the charge with my credit card company that was easily able to understand the issue and refunded the money. 3-4 weeks+ response time from customer service is absolutely embarrassing, and Adria should be ashamed of their operations. It's sad for an otherwise perfectly acceptable airline to lose a customer over 20EUR.",ATR-72,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ljubljana to Vienna,September 2017,1,1,1,1,,,1,no
Adria Airways,9,"""Two nice short flights""",20th November 2017,True,"Two nice short flights from Ljubljana to Sarajevo and back. First flight with Adria, flight back with Adria Switzerland. Flight to Sarajevo delayed due to fog in Sarajevo, Adria quickly changed an aircraft so that it was possible to land in foggy weather (CRJ instead of ATR). Product depends weather it is Adria or Adria Switzerland. Adria with snack, water and buy on board product, Adria Switzerland with snack, water, tea and coffee and without buy on board. I personally prefer the second option. Adria Switzerland provided nicer and cosier atmosphere on board, somehow a kind of premium product compare to Adria mainline.",CRJ700 / ATR72,Business,Economy Class,Ljubljana to Sarajevo,November 2017,1,1,1,1,,,1,yes
Adria Airways,2,"""extremely bad service""",27th October 2017,False,We were 11 people coming in with a short connection to Zurich hoping to continue with Adria to Ljubjana. We were before final call at the departure gate. Other people were still boarding. Adria had decided to rebook us and could not put us back on the plane. I and my wife had no checked in baggage. We had to wait 5 hours for next flight. This was extremely bad service and will do our utmost to never have to fly Adria again. We will also warn all our flying friends.,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Zurich to Ljubjana,October 2017,1,1,,1,,,1,no
Adria Airways,2,"""never fly this airline again""",16th September 2017,False," Ljubljana to Munich after arriving from Atlanta on Delta. Flight was ok, short 50 min. But they lost our baggage, if we didn't persistently call the airport we wouldn't have our bags for a week because they are lazy. One bag was badly damaged and things missing. We did everything they told us to do to report it but they didn't honor it and it took 3 months for them to pay us around 20% of the replacements and extra expenses we had for days. Very rude, try to blame it on the customer, if you don't live in Slovenia and your only communication is over emails it takes 2 to 3 weeks for them to reply even if you send them email right after they sent one. That day they lost baggage for 3 different passengers and when we had our return flight there were two more passengers that said they lost their bags so this is normal for that airline. It was a cheaper option to fly with them, but it was not worth the extra cost later. I would never fly this airline again.

Adria Airways,9,"""can't remember a flight delay""",19th April 2017,False,"Ljubljana to Zurich on April 18th. Adria Airways has become in recent years a more reliable airline which I use for these flights. I can't remember a delay and I fly them once a month. Flight Attendants are professionel. Food and Drinks (except water) have to be purchased. Sandwiches are tasty, wine choice could be better. Newspapers are available for free but mostly in Slovenian language only. Seat pitch on emergency exits are above international standards and safety seems to be their Nr. 1 aim as it is one of the rare airlines having extra safety instructions for passengers seated on emergency exit seats. Their inflight magazine is available online or printed.

Adria Airways,8,"""seat was quite comfortable """,27th January 2017,False," Ljubljana to Vienna. After a fast boarding procedure the plane took off in time. The seat was quite comfortable although the cabin looked a bit nagged. Despite the fact that this was a regional flight, Adria Airways offered a Wifi service with good connection, an IFE system and free chat function amongst the passengers. A very friendly crew welcomed the passengers onboard and started their service which was pretty impressive for this 50 minutes flight.

What a great surprise as you arrive to your seat. Loved it. Although the meal wasn't the best, it was good and the wine very good. The first row is very spacious and lots of legroom, which is not always guaranteed for bulkhead.

Adria Airways,5,"""value for money is not there nor the experience""",3rd November 2016,False," Fly only if no other connection, I am a frequent business flyer mostly departing from Vienna or Munich to destinations. The flight with Adria was chosen due to convenience, however if I had an option to choose next time, the value for money is not there nor the experience. Outdated aircraft (buzzing from AC in the upper compartment present the whole time of descending and extremly anoying. Complimentary glass of water and snack (pretzles). Other options only upon payment (does not seem acceptable fot the price over 400 eur). Not to mention online check in unavailable from Paris, while the traffic to the airport is unpredictable, hence online check in is a must. All in all I would fly Adria again only if there is no other option left. The aircraft staff though very nice.",,Business,Economy Class,CDG to LJU,November 2016,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Adria Airways,2,"""fleet is tired and outdated""",21st October 2016,False," Munich to Ljubljana. Adria Airways as the national carrier pretty much holds a monopoly in this market and even those few carriers who had flown limited scheduled routes into the Slovenian capital, Air France and Swiss, have regretfully withdrawn their services. I have spent a lifetime of flying and the Adria product, I am sorry to say, is grossly inadequate. There is nothing appealing about Adria's offering and what incentive do they have to lift their standard when there is no competition to stimulate improvement? The entire fleet is tired and outdated. The business class product is non existent, staff are at best disinterested, leaning towards unfriendly. And what's with those announcements? They are completely impossible to understand, not just in English and German but also in Slovenian. If not having flown as often as I have to know what the announcements are about, there is no hope in hell that a normal person can understand the dribble that comes over the PA. Guess how many uninformed passengers does that make for? If one is not fluent in a language, and heavily accented, then one must slow down so others can hopefully understand you. But what's their excuse of not pronouncing Slovenian correctly. Everything is executed at such a speed so they can place a tick against that task, yet no care is invested to make sure the task is executed effectively. ! Pick up your game or your end will come one day when monopoly is broken (look around the world to learn from other such stories).  I have found a solution to avoid flying Adria Airways where possible - Turkish Airlines presence is now pretty strong in LJU and I can't fault their service. Whenever flying into LJU from a geographical destination where IST is a logical place to transit, TK is my carrier of choice.",CRJ-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,MUC to LJU,October 2016,1,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Adria Airways,3,"""underwhelming and unimpressive""",10th October 2016,False," Ljubljana to Amsterdam. First experience with Adria Airways was underwhelming and unimpressive. Flight sat on tarmac fully boarded for 20 minutes without explanation; causing 20 minute delay on arrival without comment from crew and despite many passengers with tight connections in AMS. Crew was the least personal I've experienced in my 30+ flights in 2016. The crew quickly passed through the cabin holding a large bottle of water but without offering it; everything else is buy-on-board at unappealing prices. Aging CRJ-900 showed its wear, limited on-air entertainment, but able to select bulkhead seat at check-in so legroom was good. Compared to inbound flight on Air France, Adria lacked any sort of the polished, personal touch that its in-flight magazine claims it wants to project. To LJU, however, the options are few and the schedules erratic, so Adria will often be the only rational choice for many sectors.",CRJ-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LJU to AMS,October 2016,1,1,1,1,1,,1,no

JP395 flight back on Aug 30 could not be more different. A319 cabin tired and uncomfortable, flight almost empty, cabin crew could not be more unprofessional, tired and not interested. A nightmare of a crew. The worst was a purser. I have never experienced such unmotivated flight attendant with totally not acceptable appearance.

Very friendly and helpful staff - excellent business class service including a hot meal, warm bread cheese and marmalade. Better than the LH business class service.

Boarding was on-time, but aircraft was parked on remote gate about 15 minutes from main terminal. So we departed about 25 minutes late.

Adria Airways,6,"""service of a low cost airline""",4th September 2015,False,"Adria Airways has the price of a regular airline, but the service of a low cost airline. All the beverages and food are for purchase. The seats are fine, staff is friendly. Since we usually travel very early in the morning or very late in the evening, we use the flight to rest. Every time we ask for a pillow, we get one. It might sound strange, but this is very important for us.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ljubljana to Brussels,August 2015,1,1,,1,,,1,yes

Adria Airways,7,Adria Airways customer review,10th April 2015,False,Outbound flight FRA/PRN A319. 2 hours 10 min flight. I thought drinks/snacks for sale but sandwich soft drinks were served complimentary. Inbound flights SKP/LJU/FRA CRJ900. each 1 hour 30 min flight. Skyshop menu was in a seat pocket and drinks/snacks were for sale. All flight crews were friendly. Security check at the Ljubljana airport for transit passengers was chaos however it's possible to go to a gate within 30min.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,,N/A,,1,yes

Adria Airways,9,Adria Airways customer review,14th September 2014,False,Flew Zurich-Ljubljana on JP365 newish CRJ900. Flight almost full departure on time. Service on board by 2 pleasant and friendly female flight attendants. I bought coffee mineral water and a very nice and fresh filled croissant for EUR 6. Good value!,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,,N/A,,1,yes
Adria Airways,8,Adria Airways customer review,6th September 2014,False,Adria serves this 100 min flight from Ljubljana to Amsterdam on a brand new CRJ900 Next Gen which has a hugely improved cabin. Much more spacious higher ceiling and with big windows. The seats seem to be more comfortable and have more legroom. The business class is not separated from the main cabin though not even with the standard back seat curtain. The food offering could be slightly improved for usually I've had good meals on Adria.,,,Business Class,,,1,1,1,,1,,1,yes
Adria Airways,4,Adria Airways customer review,16th June 2014,False,"WAW-SKJ Economy. No free snacks or drinks on this Star Alliance partner. Just full legacy carrier fares for basically a budget airline. Flying out of Poland had no Euros or USD on me. I was thirsty and asked to purchase a bottle of water. The stewardess said that I could not buy it and could not use a credit card or purchase it in cash without their preferred currency. When I pointed out that they were able to sell duty free with visa cards she huffed and puffed and basically said it would be ""difficult"". She never offered me a tiny cup of water. On the way back I switched to Turkish Airlines via IST and got a free 3 course meal on both segments and friendly service.",,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,,1,,1,no
Adria Airways,9,Adria Airways customer review,8th June 2014,False,Sarajevo-Frankfurt via Ljubljana. I loved flying with them. Very small airline but a functional one. Crew friendly on board nothing special regarding entertainment or service. But flight duration's were short too so nothing to complain about. What I loved the most was a fast transit process in Ljubljana since its small airport and immigration was very fast. Would choose them again on my future trips.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,,1,,1,yes
Adria Airways,5,Adria Airways customer review,1st June 2014,False,I had flights from Paris to Sarajevo via Ljubljana. Adria Airways provides a low cost product these days. The food and beverages become for purchase including water. This is acceptable for short flights but it should be clearly indicated during the ticket purchase on their web-site. There are no hot options and quality of sandwiches is really poor. Besides the service was very friendly and efficient. Both flights arrived on time.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,,N/A,,1,yes
Adria Airways,9,Adria Airways customer review,10th May 2014,False,LJU to FRA and back both flights were on time. Flights were made by CRJ900 NextGen aircraft. Very clean cabin and comfortable seats. Staff were always nice and friendly. New SkyShop service was excellent with nice prices and it's not too expensive.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,,1,,1,yes
Adria Airways,8,Adria Airways customer review,13th January 2014,False,On my Ljubljana - Munich flight in business class Adria used the CRJ-900 Next Generation which is a great plane. I love the very large windows which are at a proper height so that you don't have to bend your neck down in order to look out the window like on the older versions of this Bombardier equipment. Moreover the aircraft is very quiet. It's a short flight but in business class you got a good meal and a comfy seat.,,,Business Class,,,1,1,1,,1,,1,yes
Adria Airways,1,Adria Airways customer review,6th January 2014,False,Flights from LJU to ZRH and back all on time.

Very clean and comfortable cabin on CRJ900 aircraft.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,,1,,1,yes
Adria Airways,9,Adria Airways customer review,22nd October 2013,False,I was very satisfied with the CRJ 900 on my flight from Zagreb to Istanbul.

Adria Airways,7,Adria Airways customer review,28th August 2013,False,I was on JP650 the evening departure to Istanbul on 28th August. It was on a very clean Airbus A319 and it was a light load flight. The crew were warm and kind especially the Purser who took her time walked and talked to several passengers. They even offered me a pillow and blanket which I appreciated. A warm refreshment with selections of cold/hot beverage were offered on this 2 hours flight. We took off about 5 minutes earlier and landed more or less 20 minutes earlier. It was a relaxing flight and I do hope they will be flying to more destinations in the future since Slovenia is a beautiful and lovely country to visit.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,,1,,1,yes
Adria Airways,8,Adria Airways customer review,19th August 2013,False,VIE-LJU LJU-MUC Aug 4-15th CRJ200. Both flights very good. Clean cabin comfortable seats (always cramped in CRJ) efficient and attractive cabin crew announcements made in Slovenian and pretty good English and German. Water bottle for each passenger even on short flights like these and coffee offered on second flight. Aircraft departed on time boarding was efficient captain kept passengers updated no IFE of course bags arrived very quickly. In LJU nicely stocked Priority Pass lounge and is a nice small airport MUC is an awesome airport to connect through. Would highly recommend this little regional airline and Slovenia is beautiful.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,,N/A,,1,yes
Adria Airways,7,Adria Airways customer review,19th August 2013,False,If I have to fly a regional jet then I prefer the new generation CRJ 900 which Adria used on today's flight from Amsterdam to Ljubljana. It has much bigger windows which makes the cabin look more spacious. Despite Adria cutting back on a lot of their routes for what it is the service food and cabin is OK.,,,Business Class,,,1,1,1,,1,,1,yes
Adria Airways,7,Adria Airways customer review,10th June 2013,False,Istanbul-Ljubljana-Munich and return. Pre-take off on all sectors given an individual bottle of water and plastic glass. During flight some pleasant cold snacks tasty and attractively presented. Drinks on demand. Cabin crew all very friendly good eye contact and knowledge of English. Seats just normal economy ones. Transfers in Ljubljana a bit confusing. In one direction followed signs into a passage which was locked. A couple of minutes later somebody came and let us out to go through security. On the return leg did not have to go through security there. Disappointing that Ljubljana Duty Free shop does not sell alcohol after 9pm. Also that the Slovenian liqueur speciality advertised in their in-flight Duty Free catalogue is not carried on board. All flights on time.,,,Business Class,,,1,1,1,,N/A,,1,yes
Adria Airways,5,Adria Airways customer review,27th May 2013,False,Return flight Paris-Skopje via Ljubljana. All flights were on time and nice very clean planes / good flight crew. Seats were comfortable enough for a 1-2 hours flight. Boarding was easy for all flights. Ljubljana airport is very small and nice. The only downside is the absence of any snack. FA served only water and coffee/tea. This is almost like low cost airline. It is recommended airline for short flights.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,,N/A,,1,yes
Adria Airways,9,Adria Airways customer review,8th October 2012,False,BEG-LJU-BEG with CRJ200 great regional airline with excellent airport. Too bad the airport is not too busy. Both flights were on time and they had Duty Free service with certain items on special prices. Their tickets are not good may be that is a reason that they are on economic difficulties.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,,N/A,,1,yes
Adria Airways,5,Adria Airways customer review,4th July 2012,False,I fly at least once a month ZRH-LJU-ZRH. My experience is that the staff on the ground need a better education regarding how to care of passengers. If it comes to a delay and pax have to go to the info desk to change tickets and so on then you really see of how unfriendly and unprepared staff are. The airplanes could be cleaned better and I do also see some room for improvement for the flight staff.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1,yes
Adria Airways,5,Adria Airways customer review,17th June 2012,False,LTN to LJU outbound with CRJ200 return with CRJ900. Both legs on time. Just a tiny sandwich and only one round of drinks but ok for a 2 hr flight. Slow and unfriendly staff. Very little room in CRJ200 even though it was not full. Passengers had to pick up their luggage from hold upon arrival to LJU and carry the bags to the terminal building.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1,yes
Adria Airways,8,Adria Airways customer review,12th June 2012,False,Ljubljana to Brussels with CRJ900. Boarding on time. The aircraft looked quite new and very clean. Meal served was above my expectations. Cabin crew were very nice. The only thing that was bad was the seating arrangement. I sat in 13th or 14th row and that row didn't have any windows! Otherwise flight was ok.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1,yes
Adria Airways,9,Adria Airways customer review,16th February 2012,False,LJU-FRA and FRA-LJU. First flight on time return flight slightly delayed due to heavy snow in FRA. Flight attendants attentive and helpful. Delicious snacks on both flights. While waiting for take off on first leg passengers were served Slovenian sparkling wine juices and water. Comfortable seats and generous leg- room with CRJ 900 to FRA and CRJ 200 to LJU. Both airplanes very clean and seemingly well maintained all in all quite an enjoyable experience.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1,yes
Adria Airways,5,Adria Airways customer review,17th January 2012,False,LJU-FRA-LJU. Both flights on time. Flight attendants are friendly however they allowed 3 different versions of female uniforms on the same flight. A white T-shirts under an apron looks very casual for a flag-carrier. The planes are quite worn and promotional messages on the seats for an insurance company look cheap. Food is ok taking in consideration that it was just an 1 hour flight.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1,no
Adria Airways,9,Adria Airways customer review,20th September 2011,False,Smart and efficient service. Small planes but as a tall man (6ft 4) I did not feel cramped either on the CRJ-200 (AMS-LJU) or the CRJ-900 (LJU-AMS). The cabin crew were friendly and the food for such a short flight was good. Also the price was right.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1,yes
Adria Airways,9,Adria Airways customer review,13th September 2011,False,FRA-VIE in Business Class. A great little airline transferred to them after our transatlantic flight. The advantage for the CRJ sitting on a remote stand was that we got a really interesting ride around Frankfurt airport with operating aircraft taxiing landing taking off all around us. Onboard the crew were pleasant and managed to serve a hot lunch to us during the 60 mins flight. We departed and arrived on time and the flight was smooth.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,1,yes
Adria Airways,1,Adria Airways customer review,13th September 2011,False,London Gatwick to Ljubljana and Ljubljana to Vienna in Business Class. Delayed slightly at Gatwick but that happens. Otherwise very good flights. Cabin crew friendly and welcoming ensuring that you were okay - without being too pushy and forward. Short flights and light meals/snacks served.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,1,yes
Adria Airways,7,Adria Airways customer review,19th January 2011,False,ZRH to LJU as a continuation to a flight with Swiss. Adria were not as good as Swiss but they did make us feel welcome onboard and look after us. The return flight was much better than the outbound flight with the cabin crew smiling and talking to passengers. The CRJ was clean and looked in better condition than other airlines equipment I have flown in the past.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1,yes
Adria Airways,5,Adria Airways customer review,7th January 2011,False,I fly Adria a lot (at least once a month) and find them ok. The service is mixed. Often the supervisor is not ready for boarding and there is no-one to greet. Last time when I boarded the crew were having their photo taken on the tarmac so we all had to stand and wait until they finished. Food is fine and the hand luggage service where it is delivered on the tarmac on landing works well on the CRJ aircraft.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1,no
Adria Airways,5,Adria Airways customer review,10th October 2010,False,I fly Adria quite a lot (aprox 2 flts a month). My routes are normally VIE-LJU or ZRH-LJU. I always wondered why Adria is not high profile airline being small can be a plus. The CRJ200 and 1000 are OK specially 1000 which are brand new and also A319 latest delivery. I hate that they never board on time neither depart on time. For 20 pax you should be in the air in about 15 min. But they lose a lot of time after the boarding is completed and the take off. The service is worse every time. Now you get a small pack of seeds or dry fruit and a bottle of water. The flights are normally only 30 mins but nevertheless I miss the nice box with good sandwich water and a small dessert. The price is well overpriced for what they offer. There were old inflight magazines in cabin. Crew is good but sometimes too familiar with passengers or fellow colleagues.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1,no
Adria Airways,6,Adria Airways customer review,25th November 2009,False,"This was my first time with Adria. Short hop from KBP to LJU. The airline is 3 star but my ticket had 5 star price tag. Online sale worked fine online check-in system issued me a pass with wrong boarding time (nearly 2 hours early). Luckily their call center worked well and I was told to report to the airport at normal time and use ""wrong"" boarding pass. It really worked. There were about 14 passengers onboard Canadair200. The plane was new and clean. Seats were very narrow however seat pitch was okay. My seat didn't work well so I did take off and landed in reclined position. Food was much below average (small cheese sandwich) bar service was good and generous. Flight departed late but made it in the air and landed about ontime. Crew were cheerful and attentive. My special meal was delivered and was okay (much better then standard sandwiches offered to other passengers). All in all a real strong 3 star experience but overpriced ticket. Also saw no difference between business and economy cabin. Same seats for different price.",,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1,yes
Adria Airways,7,Adria Airways customer review,27th May 2009,False,ZRH-LJU-ZRH with CRJ-900. New plane with pleasant cabin interior and comfortable leather seats. Flights on time food ok. Adria Airways has new uniforms (60 style) and the flight attendants are attentive. Web-Check-in works excellent.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1,yes
Adria Airways,5,Adria Airways customer review,26th May 2009,False,It is reliable and with good connections between Balkans and Western Europe. However I always find the service on the leg between Skopje and Ljubljana to be lower quality than the leg Ljubljana- Amsterdam Ljubljana - Frankfurt etc. The crew is not so friendly and helpful they always offer tuna sandwiches (assuming that because of the Muslim travelers). I insisted on a ham sandwich and never got it. Twice on the leg Ljubljana-Skopje (or vice versa). If Adria pretends to be a quality part of Star Alliance it shouldn't distinguish among the passengers which fly Skopje - Ljubljana and those flying from Ljubljana to Western Europe.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1,yes
Adria Airways,3,Adria Airways customer review,28th February 2009,False,LGW-LJU in Y class. Adria Airways now offer check in on line so it was straight to security which was great. Boarding quick and efficient. Plane downgraded from CRJ9 to CRJ2 but emergency exit seat reservation honoured. Waited on the stand for 30 minutes with no communication from the flight deck. Service was nice with sandwiches hot and cold drinks. Cabin crew were quite robotic seems that pursers are trained not to smile under any circumstances. If crew would have been bit more cheerful and communication from the flight deck bit better it would have been 4*.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,4,Adria Airways customer review,29th May 2008,False,London to Tirana via Ljubljana Economy Class. 30 minutes late on first leg due to air traffic restrictions at Gatwick but Adria held the connecting flight for us even though there were only a handful of people transferring from the London flight. The food was adequate on both legs and the crew were friendly. All in all a perfectly acceptable journey and I would fly Adria again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,4,Adria Airways customer review,12th May 2008,False,Ljublijana-Amsterdam. A great little airline. Although the CRJ-200 is a little cramped the service was good with a proper meal adequate refreshments and competent cabin crew. Their inflight magazine is in English and Slovenian and has an interesting mix of articles and company information. Same can't be said about Brnk international airport however! This airport needs a 'spruce up' to say the least.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,4,Adria Airways customer review,11th February 2008,False,FRA-VIE-FRA on CRJ200. Cheapest option when compared to Lufthansa and Austrian plying this short 1.5 hour flight. Small plane meant a long bus ride to remote stand position. Larger carry-on bags had to be deposited in a trolley parked next to the plane. Aircraft spotless but leather seats showing their age - quite saggy in the squab. Service consisted of a choice of crusty cheese or ham roll followed by drinks tea & coffee. FAs smiling. The return was similarly uneventful but again a long bus ride at FRA. Luggage claim was quick.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,4th October 2007,False,BRU-LJU-BRU. Outward flight on a CRJ200 very nice - comfortable excellent service and a good breakfast. Return flight on a 737 leased from Ukrainian airlines was also reasonable despite the limited legroom. Earning Star Alliance points also a plus - would recommend.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,8th August 2007,False,I often fly with Adria (50 flights per year). Since Adria is member of Star Alliance there are pretty good connections to the most destinations in Europe. The onboard service is good staff quiet nice. Home base airport in Ljubljana has been upgraded and is getting more international. The business lounge is not on the level it should be - old furniture bad food choice dark. The 3 stars that have been given to Adria are correct.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,14th July 2007,False,LGW-LJU-LGW on an older but clean A320. Outwards in 7A with plenty of legroom return in 12F with adequate legroom but need to be careful as the plastic shell on the bottom of the seat in front had started to crack with some sharp edges. Cheese roll served outbound and a jam filled croissant on the return - better than nothing but room for improvement. Coffee and soft drinks free but only one round early in the flight. Very pleasant crew on both sectors. Only gripe was baggage collection at LJU - three flights on one carousel and they seemed to unload baggage in batches from each flight turn about which caused chaos. The second carousel sat unused for the first 40 minutes waiting!,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,24th March 2007,False,Frankfurt-Ljubljana-Munich in business class: the first flight was on a B737 in the colours of Ukraine International and that plane's interior was substandard while the second flight was on a new CRJ. Both flights on time and without glitch. The service is friendly but meals should be improved. Overall they gave the impression of being a pleasant short haul airline.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,9th October 2006,False,Zurich-Ljubljana return. About 2 hours+ journey. Both sector uses the Bombardier Regional Jet CRJ200. Small plane but the 2-3 crews on both sectors were friendly and the service efficient. Seats were comfortable and the planes in good clean conditions. Light meals were served - generally a roll here or a pie there plus drinks. The inflight magazine is surprisingly rich with information on Slovenian culture and way of life and is one of the best I have read. You board the planes on the tarmac via buses from the gates though and not through connecting bridges.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,29th September 2006,False,LGW-LJU return. Outbound was on A320 seated towards the front of Y-class on a very empty flight. The crew were friendly enough and served a ham or cheese roll and round of drinks. LJU airport was easy to use and out within minutes. The coach ride into town goes through some nice Slovenian countryside. Return was on a B737-500 flight was full and had a middle seat but exit row (9E) seat pitch was great. Again right after take off was served with a cream pie desert and drinks. Crew were again friendly and another smooth flight that landed about 15mins ahead of schedule.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,27th September 2006,False,LGW-LJU-LGW last week overall impressed with standard of service on A320. The food in economy was very basic but I didn't expect any! Drinks free. Was allocated row 11 (emergency exit) with out asking she said your very tall(6'4) I will give you some more leg room! Only minor complaint was the seat base comfort it was rock hard like sitting on a wood bench. On the return the seat in row 25 was little better they seem to have cut back on the foam. Crew were excellent a nice airline all in all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,2nd August 2006,False,DUB-NAP. Was expecting very poor standards of both safety and comfort from this airline but was surprised. Flight at 5.00 am and the FA's were refreshed and alert. Pre flight safety procedures were clear and as high a standard as any other 3 star airline. The seats were quite hard and leg room was limited but the flight was made pleasant by friendly FA's. In flight catering was poor considering it was a four hour flight. We were handed almost frozen sandwiches and a juice box. Baggage collection was mayhem. All in all the flight was fair and would fly Adria again - but the airline does not compare to other 3 star airlines such as Aer Lingus and KLM.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,21st February 2006,False,Frankfurt to Vienna and was quite satisfied. I was surprised when the flight attendant started giving out meals as I did not expect to be fed at all on such a short flight of only 55 minutes. It was perhaps a bit cramped on board the Canadair Regional Jet though I wouldn't complain about it. Crew was overall quite friendly and efficient.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,1st October 2005,False,Flew to Ljubljana from Gatwick. Plane was a new Canadair Regional Jet small (40 seats) but good leg room and comfortable. Both cabin crew were friendly. Food was just a cheese or ham roll but fine for a 1 hr 40 minute flight. And Adria were one of the only airlines leaving Gatwick that evening not to be delayed. Return flight was an A320 full comfortable and good service once again. Would recommend Adria again and worth paying the extra 20quid over Easyjet for flying from Gatwick and not having to pay for food or drink.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,15th September 2005,False,Round trip LGW - LJU in Economy Class both legs on an A320. Service pretty friendly planes clean & well-maintained flights on time. Food on each leg (outbound mid-morning return early morning) was a simple processed cheese roll though for a two-hour flight the food is probably not the most important aspect of the journey. All-in-all a pretty reasonable experience with no major complaints.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,3rd December 2004,False,I have used their VIE-FRA-VIE service several times. All flights were on time the atmosphere on board (CRJ) fine service is friendly although their snack and drinks are not outstanding. But for a flight of 1 hour what should it be? Codesharing with LH enables to collect miles though they dont count for status.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,18th March 2004,False,Flew march 12/14 on JP from ZRH-LJU-ZRH. The flights were on time the flight attendants nice and helpful. The sandwich has got an upgrade and is now equal to LH. A Minus point was that they were handing out only Apple Juices - if you wanted to have wine or other drinks you had to ask specifically for it. This gives me kind of a cheap impression as it seems to the passenger that they wanted to hide it from them. The wine they served was below industry standards and not what a wine country like Slovenia should serve its guests on their trip to the country. I absolutely agree that on such short legs there is no necessity of any food/drinks however either this is clearly defined in the service guide of the airline or then crews should adhere to their service guidelines.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,1st November 2003,False,Round trip LGW - LJU in Business Class. Check-in staff at LGW very efficient and friendly. A320 clean and staff most helpful. Food and Wine need improvement. Flights all on time and overall a pleasant experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,31st July 2003,False,In July 2003 I flew London (Gatwick)-Ljubljana-Skopje return in Business Class. Overall I was quite impressed. All flights departed and arrived on time and the onboard service was efficient and reasonably friendly. Hot meals were served on all flights although the quality of these varied from disgusting to just OK. All drinks were complimentary. The aircraft (A320 and CRJ) were modern and spotlessly clean. Business Class seating is identical to economy with a moveable curtain. Transiting at Ljubljana was painless although it is a very small airport and the Business Class lounge is nothing special. I would happily fly with them again although they do need to improve the quality of their meals.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,6th December 2002,False,I have just returned from a long weekend in Ljubljana flying on Adria from London Gatwick. The outbound flight was ok (food portions were a bit stingy given the 2 hour 20 minute flight time) and we arrived early into Ljubljana. Beware about arriving on a Saturday - the coach to the city centre are few and far between. I ended up taking a taxi which cost me 6500 SIT (about UKP 20) whereas the bus was 600 SIT (1.40). On the return flight Adria cancelled the flight for 'technical reasons'. Judging by the low number of people that went to the passenger service counter I think the reason for cancellation may have been more economic than technical. I was rerouted via Munich which added over an hour and a half to the journey and we flew into Heathrow (with BA) instead of Gatwick which left me with a useless train ticket and no way of getting home. The flight to Munich with Adria was good and an edible snack was served with apple juice. Despite the problems with the return journey Adria seems to be a reasonable airline and is an ok (if not the only) choice to get to this country.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,25th August 2002,False,I have flown Adria recently on a LH code share from Munich to Ljubjana and return. In both cases the plane was a brand new CRJ. Both flights were really smooth and the crews really efficient and helpful. Pilots kept us informed about everything during both flights. It was sunset and dusk and the flight over the alps was absolutely scenic. Despite the narrow cabin of the CRJ the pitch is quite generous and the leather seats comfortable. Both flights lasted 45 minutes and from MUC to LJU I travelled tourist class. Normally in short flights there isnt time for much than a drink. We receive an apple juice a cheese and salad sandwich plus coffee and tea. The LJU-MUC and due to an overbooking was on business. We were offered an orange juice prior to departure and then a tasty breakfast consisting in bacon and scramble eggs fruit salad a croissant and coffe and tea. Superb for such a short segment. Not being a prime choice its an airline which is pleasant to flight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Aegean Airlines,1,"""Most disappointing experience""",8th June 2024,True," Most disappointing experience.

Aegean Airlines,1,"""Aegean doesn't want to refund""",26th May 2024,True," When booking we had two choices, the cheapest one to go from RHO-ATH-BCN but arrive there at 01:00 am where there are no buses for our end destination (Costa Brava) or the more expensive one to go from RHO-ATH-SKG-BCN but arrive there at 17:00. So we took the second option as we were going there for a festival and we did not want to miss any of the events as they were starting on the 16th of May and also to take a bus from the airport of Barcelona to Costa Brava instead of a taxi that would cost a fortune. Then, due to about two hours of delay at the flight from ATH-SKG we asked if we are going to miss our transit flight from SKG to BCN, and if so to let us not travel to Thessaloniki and take the later flight from Athens. They told us that they will wait for us as it is a transit flight. We arrived there 5 minutes after the flight was scheduled, and of course they didn't wait for us, and they changed our tickets for the next day via Munich. We demanded that they change them back to go via Athens and then again Barcelona, which after 2-3 hours of waiting time and many food costs at the airport, they did. So we arrived at Barcelona at 01:00 after midnight and our only means of transport was a taxi, which costed us 170€, and of course we missed 1 day out of 4 of the festival. Of course Aegean doesn't want to refund any of these costs. M On our way back they lost our baggage. 24 hours later we received one back, but the second we are still waiting (3 days later). And the worst part is that noone actually informs us on anything, they don't know where the bag is, they don't know if they found it, if we are taking it back or anything.

If they were to make the tickets a little pricier from the beginning but therefore reduce the hassle at the counter my journey would have been more pleasant and not started with frustration.,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Athen to Frankfurt,March 2023,1,1,1,1,,,1,no
Aegean Airlines,1,"""Very poor service""",24th July 2023,True," At check-in, we were told that our checked baggage was too heavy (limit 8kg/17lbs even though the website said 23kg/50lb limit), and we needed to reduce the weight. We were put to the side so we could move our dirty laundry from the suitcases and put into tote bags (purchased from the nearby shop) that we could carry on. This was both embarrassing and frustrating. The plane was an hour late for our connecting flight. They didn't tell us, but fortunately (after running through the airport), our connection was also late, so we did make the plane. They stopped food service short, so the last 5 rows didn't get any food. This was not due to weather, but just bad timing of the stewards. We still had 30 minutes to land, so they could have quickly handed out the sandwiches, but they decided not to provide service to the last few rows. I don't know if it was due to poor planning of the start of food service, or of taking too much time in the middle rows. Instead of treating us like the rest of the passengers, we felt like 3rd class citizens. Very poor service.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Heraklion to Istanbul via Athens,July 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Aegean Airlines,1,"""We expected meaningful compensation""",19th July 2023,True," I had a flight me and my husband from Stockholm to Cairo with connection flight in Athens. The connecting flight number was A3930, from Athens to Cairo. The planned departure time was 11:55 pm June 25th. The flight was delayed by nearly 6 hours from the planned departure time. We were informed the flight will be delayed for 1 hour before boarding. Before the new departure time, we boarded normally. After that, a lot of time has passed “ more that 1 hour” while we are inside the aircraft and we don’t take off and no information were given to us by the crew. From the aircraft windows we could see some workers taking bags in and out the aircraft. The crew told us they are having problems with luggage.  We are kept in the aircraft to nearly 4 hours before the captain told us that we can leave the aircraft and go to sit in the airport till the problem is solved.  Nothing was offered to us in the airport, no food, drinks or anything. In the meantime I tried to contact the Aegean Airlines hotline to help us, it was nearly 5:00 am already, but the contact person told me that she can not know any information about my flight situation because she has a limited access to information and she cannot help and I can call again after 7:00 am for another contact who has more access. At nearly 6:00 am the crew called us to board again but we didn’t take off till 6:35 anyways because the crew was replaced by a new one. We reached Cairo airport finally to find that our baggage didn’t reach Cairo airport anyway and we waited for 2 weeks till they reached Cairo airport. The delay collectively was from 11:55 pm to 6:35 am. We expected an apology on what happened and meaningful compensation as an acknowledgment of what they did. We complained to the company and their reply was that they were sorry for the delay and they offered the least compensation stated by passengers’ rights “250 euros”. They mentioned nothing about the problems that are caused by the poor handling of the problems they had. ",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Stockholm to Cairo via Athens,June 2023,1,1,1,1,,,1,no

Aegean Airlines,1,"""pretty bad track record""",11th July 2023,False,"We took 3 flights with Aegean and would not recommend them to anyone. Had 3 issues: 1. They overbooked our flight and bumped many people. We bought our flight 3 months ahead, but checked in about 18 hours before our flight (they allow check-in up to 24 hours ahead). We were issued a “standby” ticket without any seats. When we got to the gate, we were told we may or may not get onto the flight and if we didn’t then we would have to wait 4 hours for the late night flight, or try again in the morning. Lots of other people in the same situation. We were never issued boarding passes but we kept following up with the person at the ticket counter until they gave us passes, it seems like due to our persistence and nothing systematic. Luckily we got on that flight, but others didn’t. Nowhere in the policy does it say that whether or not you get on the flight is related to your check-in time. If you take Aegean, check in right away and be persistent about asking for seats! 2. They apply a checked bag policy at will. We were sitting near the gate. The gate attendants approached us and asked to weigh our bags. Our bags, which fit easily into any overhead bin (including previous Aegean flights) were found to be slightly overweight (apparently 9kgs are allowed, ours were about 10kgs). We asked if we could move 1kg into our purse / backpack. They said no, they need to check the two bags, and by the way they are charging us 40Euro per bag. This was for a 45 min flight from an island to Athens. We had no choice and were forced to pay. Also, there was no consistency in the way this rule was applied. We saw plenty of other people with carry-ons larger than ours allowed on the plane and there was plenty of space in the overhead bins. 3. Every flight we were on was late. Two of three were late by over 45 mins. We didn’t have any connections, but I imagine many connecting flights were missed. And, this didn’t happen to us, but it’s worth noting that when we landed in Athens, there were about 30 people waiting at the lost baggage desk. Most of them looked very angry. I asked one person what happened, and apparently an entire flight did not have their bags transferred at a connection. So not only will they force you to check your carry-on and then pay for a checked bag, they might lose it too.

The cabin service was outstanding. We received a snack (more of a light meal) on each flight, and both were delicious. The first flight included a small sandwich roll with sliced chicken and cheese; the second flight included a pasta salad with tuna and dressing. We enjoyed every bite! As we were leaving the plane in Larnaca I commented to the cabin staff at the exit of the plane that Aegean Airlines was now my new favorite airline. And it is. I opted to give the airline a rating of 9 instead of 10 due to two items: both flights were short. Had the flights been longer (more of a test of the airline service), I would have given the maximum rating. Also, Aegean's website is not as intuitive as most others I've used.

I went up to a staff member when most people who appeared to be Corfu residents had just gone home, and asked was there any hotel booking arrangements - ""No"", any hotel used in such circumstances, don't know, any cost max, don't know, what about meals, don't know. Reclaiming? - ""you have to go to Aegean office in Athens"". I spoke to a British Corfu resident who said most expensive hotel open was Corfu Palace. I chose to go somewhere with a little better location and not so expensive. I then found out from the lady that just after I left, she was told that anyone needing a hotel could go to the Corfu Palace and all meals etc were covered and no need to pay. So, overall great experience - really well done ground crew: vital information not provided on a timely basi. The later flight was full as the following day was a general strike in Greece - so 2 nights had to stay in Corfu.

Especially the new planes are really nice, and the service on board is good too. The food is really not that bad, especially in business class. However, Economy is great as well. There are some nice touches with Aegean, like how they inform you when your flight is delayed. They email you, and you get a notification in the app. About the app, it works really good.

And it is not due to the overall mess that happened this past summer I'm so many European airpors. I can understand that delays pile up along the day but, knowing that this happens, they should review their schedules. Or try to catch up during the flight. The excuse is most times the same, the ridiculous ""late arrival of the aircraft"" (thank you!). Their app is also faulty lately (you call then, show them, and still don't accept it, things like not being able to check in, wrong pricing information, no incoming messages with flight delays, etc. Also, when they change planes and they cannot relocate you in a pay seat, you have to call them to get a refund! What they don't miss is to send a a silly survey upon landing asking about the quality of the service on board (""forcing"" you to chose an area of improvement!), while not asking for the end-to-end experience (from reservation, check in, baggage drop, boarding, disembarkation, luggage).

Our calls and emails went unanswered. 10 days later we finally received our luggage that was come how found in Austria. We filed a reimbursement claim for initial expenses accrued in Skopje, for personal items and clothing replacement. Once again no word from Aegean. I repeated this process 3 times to no avail.

On the 2nd flight, I did see an attendant walking around the airport waiting room looking at bags, but she never weighed or measured anything. Both times the planes were delayed, though in their defense, most of the time I've flown in Europe pre and post pandemic, flights are delayed. The flight attendants were nice on both flights - always smiles and always helping. They never seemed to be unhappy, and some of the best I've encountered. I was impressed that they served a light meal and a beverage on my 3.5 hour flight and beer or wine didn't cost anything. Tui on the other hand, for the same length of flight, charged for food and/or drink and the leg room was much smaller, though their TUI allows 10kgs of carry-on luggage v. 8kgs for Aegean. I'd rather have the luggage allowance higher than the light meal and drink.

With the official 1:05h connecting time it sounded sporty. A biscuit, yogurt, and drinks were served as breakfast, then crew then went behind the curtains and did not show up again until the final approach to Athens. During the descent, they asked the passengers to put the garbage including cups with liquids into the seat pockets. Delayed by 40 minutes we landed in Athens.

Aer Lingus,1,“quite rude and unhelpful”,10th June 2024,False,I recently flew from Malaga to Dublin with  Aer Lingus on May 16th. Unfortunately after landing I discovered my suitcase had been badly damaged. There were pieces broken off it and scratches all over it. I tried to search the website to see how to lodge a baggage complaint but it’s very difficult to find what to do. So I tried to contact their customer service on May 18th but I could only get a chat bot. I explained everything and this chat bot said someone would contact me as soon as possible. I waited for a phone call or email but nothing came. So on May 27th I called the customer service team and got speaking to a man who told me you have to search for after flight services and then he told me what to do to lodge a baggage complaint. So I did this and I received back a reply stating that I didn’t lodge the complaint in the correct manner within seven days so my claim was void. I explained how I was waiting as I was told someone would contact me however this fell on deaf ears. On May 31st I called customer service again as nobody was replying in my claim. They were quite rude and unhelpful so I asked for a supervisor to contact me which I was told would happen in a few days. I called back on June 5th as nobody rang me. I was told a supervisor would contact me within 24-48 hours. I again called back today (June 10th) as nobody called me. The guy I spoke with today told me the other agents forgot to put a request in for a supervisor to call me but he has done now and one will call me within 24 hours.

Couldn't understand any announcements from the flight deck the speaker system was so bad. The food was just barely edible and breakfast was just awful. Cold sandwich of some kind. I asked for some extra sugar for coffee and you would have thought it was asking for gold. I hoped the return flight would be better. It was not. We received the same treatment on our return flight on the 24th May out of Dublin to San Francisco. We also booked a flight through Aer Lingus to Scotland from Dublin and back to Dublin one week later, on their connector airline called Emerald Air. On the return to Dublin emerald air broke the wheels off our luggage and split the cases beyond repair, not just one but 2 of them.

Only there was as no flight possible on that date. Was offered similar on next day. Told that Aer Lingus would reimburse us for any additional costs. Said would phone back next day to give time to discuss. Didn’t. I phoned them again. Was told by different person would be reimbursed for costs. No alternative but to book. Asked for confirmation that they would pay additional costs - claimed they were unable to do so as no outgoing mail allowed. Had to redo accommodation (move for one night ): car hire: insurance etc. A lot of hassle. Return a nightmare. Given wrong seats at Check in Orlando. Had to change at gate - tried to give us economy seats instead of Business then did issue Business but not in our names! Had to go back to sort out! No priority for embarking - had to complain -twice - before they would let us on. Shambles. On return submitted extremely modest claim - even ate in the Hotel buffet where they give 25% discount for seniors - which was immediately rejected. They say they have no obligation towards us as they gave us sufficient notification of cancellation. I have been fighting this since but am getting nowhere. They are not affiliated to any ADR so you are basically on your own. Worst customer service - absolute misnomer - ever. They lie and deny. If you have another option take it.

Aer Lingus,1,“Incredibly poor customer service”,29th February 2024,False," Customer service? They don't know the meaning of customer service. Literally pulling my hair out trying to even talk to them. They’re a shambles, don't have a clue what there doing and don't care for their customers at all. Cancelled our flight (which was pre booked 9 months in advance) they cancelled it with less than 12 hours notice and this flight was very important to us as we had paid for a very expensive 60th birthday party for my mother which cost over £3000. Hence why the flights were booked 9 months in advance. However Aer Lingus cancelled them not even 12 hours before we were due to fly. They refused a refund at first. Refused to compensate anything at all. Told me they couldn't pay for any hotel expenses etc (when they can as they refunded a friend of mine for her hotel) so shows they don't stick to the rules and discrimination comes to mind as they pick and choose who they want to refund. In the end after more than a month later and endless amounts of emails and I even wrote to them in person and paid £10 to send everything by air mail from England to Dublin. They still haven't provided the refund apart from £26 for extra baggage we paid for. Said the other £216 is on its way, still not received more than a month and still arguing with them over it. We had to pay an extra £700 for alternative flights due to Aer Lingus behaviour. We didn't get an apology or refund or nothing back. They cost us a lot of money. I would not recommend them to anyone and I will never ever use Aer Lingus to fly again. And we are regular travellers who fly every couple of months and always at least 4 of us. Sometimes groups of 10 of us. So they have lost a lot of loyal and genuine customers being my whole family just because they could not acknowledge what they did wrong or even provide a refund for our cancelled flight. Incredibly poor customer service. Also a complete lack of empathy from their staff as to my situation, it clearly just shows the contempt that Aer Lingus have for their customers.

Aer Lingus,1,“they do not value their customers”,28th February 2024,True,"In September 2023, I faced a situation with Aer Lingus that I feel compelled to share, as a stark warning to others considering this airline for their travels. After circumstances beyond my control forced me to cancel a flight I had booked, which cost me over 700 Euro, I was plunged into a customer service nightmare that left me feeling cheated and disrespected. Upon contacting Aer Lingus to discuss my options, I was informed that I would only be eligible for a refund of the taxes, amounting to a paltry 50 Euro. This was a shock to me, given the significant amount I had paid. Seeking a more reasonable solution, I requested a voucher for the full value of the ticket, hoping for some flexibility given the unforeseen nature of my cancellation. However, this request was met with an unwavering refusal, accompanied by a cold explanation that it was “too late” for such considerations. The interaction with Aer Lingus’ customer service was not only unhelpful but also distinctly unkind. At no point did I feel heard or understood; instead, I was left feeling like a mere statistic in their booking system, devoid of any human empathy or understanding. The rigidity and lack of accommodation displayed by Aer Lingus have convinced me that they do not value their customers or consider the complexities of real-life situations that may affect one’s travel plans. This experience has been deeply upsetting, not just because of the financial loss, which is significant, but also because of the realization that Aer Lingus is not an airline you can trust to treat you with fairness or compassion. Their unwillingness to provide reasonable solutions or exhibit a basic level of customer service decency is alarming. I urge anyone considering flying with Aer Lingus to think twice. There are numerous airlines out there that value their customers and understand the importance of flexible policies and compassionate service. Unfortunately, based on my experience, Aer Lingus is not among them.

Aer Lingus,2,"""To say it was rude was an understatement""",14th November 2023,True,"BHX-BHD-BHX (7 Oct - 9 Oct) Check-in counter at Birmingham Airport was quite friendly and jolly and appeared happy to speak to customers. My luggage including my friend’s were lumped into one since I had a 23kg baggage allowance. Flying back from Belfast to Birmingham on EI3646 on the 9th of October, however was the complete opposite. This review is not entirely about the baggage but the appalling attitude of the woman behind the check-in desk. I have now flown over 59 airlines in total from 5 star airlines to 2 stars and over a hundred airports around the world from a small airport in Dunedin in New Zealand to the likes of Heathrow and Changi in Singapore, but the attitude of the check-in agent for Aer Lingus at BHD is something that I haven’t encountered anywhere. I’m also a BA Silver Executive Club member (nearly gold now). To say it was rude was an understatement. She treated us like we haven’t flown before. My mate and I were trying to explain that at BHX, they’d let us combine our check-in baggage, but this woman won’t let us and she was argumentative. It looked like her other colleague felt embarrassed in her behalf. She was not a good representative of the airline. It added to our frustration that the flights were delayed out of Belfast.

Aer Lingus,1,“The airline is absolutely terrible”,30th October 2023,True,"The airline is absolutely terrible. Our flight was canceled because the engine was broken and we were given no other option than to fly into a different city and take busses. Everyone was rude and we were treated very poorly. The planes were disgusting, the food wasn't edible, the seats were tiny, the planes are clearly not well maintained and everything was broken. I know the flights are cheap, but you may be taking a bus and traveling overnight unexpectedly.

Aer Lingus,1,"""don't check any bags""",3rd October 2023,True," The service onboard and the flights themselves were ok, but the circus before and after were criminal. Returning from Manchester started with confusion and delay. Granted, some of it could be attributed to the airport but the delay and luggage problems were all Aer Lingus. Dublin was another big delay which was good otherwise we would have missed our flight. Arriving in Chicago we waited for our luggage only to find that 4 pieces had not arrived. There was no one to there to talk to and just a sign with a website for instructions. The next 10 days and hours and hours on the phone were excruciating as our next assignment was fast approaching. We had to replace many of the tools of our trade. Then when we sought refunds for the things we needed replaced and had no assurance of ever seeing before we left. Their system was so broken down that even though I sent all the needed documentation, they refunded only a portion of what they premised.

Booked 2 seats up front only to find our loading in pouring rain from rear of plane- too cheap to pay for a sky walkway onto plane. Seats uncomfortable as heck and service bad. At Dublin unloaded again in rain 15 minutes from Terminal - too cheap to unload on a sky walkway. Paid for an Airport Lounge pass in Glasgow but guess what - no lounge!

I was a nervous wreck because I hate flying. It scares me to death yet I keep doing it. This flight was pleasant upon boarding so we were off to a good start. I had my usual, initial fear on takeoff, but the flight attendants were absolutely amazing throughout the flight from beginning to end. The seats were full and comfortable with a rounded headrest that was amazingly soft. The cost was great (points) the flight attendants were superb, and there was legroom and comfortable seating.

Aer Lingus,1,"""Absolutely dreadful!""",10th September 2023,True,"Absolutely dreadful! I made the mistake of saying I was too hot, the plane was very very hot, was given some water and the air hostess then said she wanted me to see a medic, pilot came to see me and said he was happy to fly me home but air hostess decided she wasn’t happy. I was asked to go to the back of the plane to get some fresh air and see a medic, no medic boarded the plane and whilst I’m sitting there quietly the air hostess appeared with my bags and took them off the plane, I was then told to leave the plane and someone from Aer Lingus would meet me. I was dumped at a doorway and told to find my way to arrivals! Lucky for me a member of Dublin Airport staff took pity on me and assisted. I then discovered that the air hostess had not actually put my kindle paper white back in my bag and even though there was no passenger in the seat next to me, my kindle was never found. Medics were I later found out told to stand down as were no longer needed (so much for passenger care) and the desk when I finally got there was closed. A lovely man called Paul did his best to help me but ultimately I had to find somewhere to spend the night and then had to book a flight with Ryanair the following morning to get home as I should have been at work and could not get home with Aer Lingus. As none of this was my fault I asked for my money back as not only had I paid for a flight that I was not given I’d even paid to upgrade my seat that I wasn’t allowed to use.

Aer Lingus,4,"""Mediocre experience""",6th September 2023,False," Mediocre experience. First the good: the plane left and arrived on time and they did not loose my luggage. Now the bad: the temperature was frosty, at least in my section of the plane, which was the very first row of economy, so much that I was freezing with 2 blankets on me, and it was the same for the person next to me. The seats are narrow and very hard. There was no entertainment, no screens and no movies, zilch. In theory, you could use their WIFI to watch something on your laptop, but the WIFI did not work. Most transatlantic flights offer free wine but not this one. An annoying detail: the attendant insist you keep your window cover closed, even if there is light out, this was around 6 pm, yet the neon lights are on all the time in the attendant's station. The meals are very small portions. The attendants seemed distracted, I had to ask 3 different people for a morning beverage and wait 20 minutes before getting it.

On Flight EI 441 from Athens to Dublin, with a 12:55 Greek time departure, we experienced a one-hour delay and departed around 14:00 Greek time. After about 4 hours of flight, we reached Dublin airport. Despite assurances from the flight crew, we were informed that we missed the Boston flight. The staff's behavior was rude, and they provided false information. They booked me for a flight the next day from Shannon, not Dublin, with a layover in New York. Other passengers faced similar issues. After hours of lies, a staff came to our aid and admitted there were no rooms reserved for us near Shannon. Eventually, rooms were found, but the experience was disheartening. The following day, my Shannon to JFK flight went well, but the JFK to Boston flight with DELTA was delayed by an hour. I arrived in Boston on August 25th at 20:15, missing my original arrival time of August 24th at 18:50.

Aer Lingus,1,"""for compensation they denied everything""",25th August 2023,True," Aer Lingus was almost 2 hours late into Heathrow which caused all 5 of my family members to miss our United Airlines connecting flight home. Our flight was 100 feet off the ground from landing at Heathrow and then suddenly took off and we circled for over an hour. We were already 30 minutes late taking off. The crew did nothing to help those with connecting flights get off the plane first. Aer Lingus customer service at the airport was going to rebook us and pay for the new flights but couldn't find any flights for 2 days. The service rep at the airport recommended we book our own flights if we could find any and send in for compensation so that's what we did. She implied we should get some kind of compensation for the flight, hotels and other expenses. We had to stay the night in Heathrow and booked our own flights out the next day. When we submitted everything for compensation they denied everything. I tried 3 times to get them to cover at least a portion of our expenses but they did nothing. also, you cannot talk to customer service, everything is thru email. I have had several flight disruptions over the years and have never had an airline not compensate us for something. This was the worse flight disruption I've ever experienced and cost us over $10,000 to get back home.

The check-in agent was very helpful and friendly! My bag had suffered damage at Heathrow a few day earlier and the agent at Cork Airport was very informative and supportive and told me how to make a complaint. Boarding was orderly and efficient and the cabin crew on this short flight of just under one hour were not only professional but very good representatives of their airline and indeed country. I saw several people with children and an elderly gentleman being assisted unprompted by the cabin crew. Disembarkation was quick and the luggage arrived promptly too. My only gripe is the high cost of this flight in relation to the distance flown.

I had to leave home very early for the check-in as this flight departed at 640am. The queue for check-in and bag drop off was very poorly managed from a range of perspectives and created a very poor first impression of the airline. Firstly, there was a visible disagreement between 2 uniformed staff members. A member of staff was unable to use a computer and had to call one of her colleagues for help. This employee was not only unable to use the computer but was unnecessarily abrupt with customers and contradicted herself in the instructions she barked out. She could see one of the bag-drop machines was broken and sent 2 young people and an elderly couple to the machine in question and then ignorantly shouted at the elderly couple when they told her for the second time that the machine was broken. When I used a self-drop off machine, I was rudely spoken to by a man. Passengers ended up helping each other as the staff were of no help. Boarding was functional but not well organised. On this busy flight the staff were almost invisible. When the aircraft arrived into Dublin there was a delay as another aircraft was at the gate. The positive side is that the flight was punctual. Aer Lingus need to make sure that their Heathrow staff have some training in how to speak to customers in a civil manner. ",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Dublin,August 2023,1,1,,1,,,1,no

Smiling, courteous, professional flight attendants on all flights we took. From Toronto to Heathrow via Dublin and back, flights on time, but I booked properly and allowed up to 3 hrs of layover when needed.

On the website they write that is very simple, fill the form with a proof of death and that is it. In reality is it completely different, they used to ignore my emails, and change the conditions to make everything possible to not proceed with a refund. The top was, that I have to send a copy of the death certificate through the post, signed and sealed. Completely disgusting and disrespectful towards someone’s grief.

Based on math, 7 minutes didn’t seem like enough to make the connection. The flight attendant assured us no we’d be fine, and said she would make it. Incorrect. We did not make it. Now we had to go through customs. We waited for (I’m yelling in this part) ONE HOUR AND FORTY FIVE MINUTES for our luggage. We couldn’t rebook until after we retrieved our luggage. I could have dragged it from London faster. They told us to wait until 3pm (2 hours) to find out if we’d get on stand by to Chicago. We didn’t get on standby. The only option was New York the same day or Chicago the next afternoon. We do not live in New York. “We can get you to New York but you’re on your own from there”. WHAT? So my option is to spend money on a hotel and Ubers in Dublin while extending my childcare another 36 hours or spend $842 getting myself home from JFK airport. I reluctantly chose the latter, because I would’ve done a lot worse to get there. I feel disgusted. I am now so late to get home to my 1.5 year old who is eagerly waiting for me.

Aer Lingus,3,"""Worst lack of care""",21st July 2023,False," We flew Aer Lingus last summer Seattle to Dublin to Edinburgh and then back Edinburg to Dublin to Seattle. Our plane left quite late from Seattle with no explanation and we ended up getting into Dublin several hours late missing our connecting flight. No one there to help, an hour bouncing around to different Aer Lingus staff in the arrival terminal w/o one person helping us. We finally ended up outside back at check-in in a long line of rebooking passengers who were told we wouldn’t make the next Edinburgh flight as it was booked, last one out that day. The staff were unwilling to book us on Ryan Air which EU regulations say should happen as they had plenty of seats. A supervisor took pity on me and somehow got me on the last flight but we arrived in Edinburgh 5 hours or more late outside of the EU regulations with no food or drink offered or available. Aer Lingus has denied the EU regulation payment saying it’s not covered since  unforeseen circumstances on first rejection and then it was a us domestic originated flight so it isn’t covered (not true since it started in Dublin and arrived late into the States). On flight to Dublin they lost my wife’s suitcase and it didn’t get to us until the 2nd to last day in Ireland, over 72 hours when it’s considered a lost bag, we filed a claim, and not once has anyone acknowledged this reimbursement owed for the modest clothing she had to buy.

Also the WIFI is not working.

We have a short six day holiday in San Diego; Day 1 is now gone because of Aer Lingus complete and total lack of regard and concern for paying customers. We paid €2808.50 for our flights (2 people) and it is disgusting to think that once they got our money they no longer care.

I’d even recommend Spirit Airlines over Aer Lingus. They lost our bags on our recent trip and have no desire to help us get them back. Their customer service is a joke and they are incapable of providing any answers to help us understand when we can expect the bags.

Aer Lingus,7,"""would certainly use them again""",14th June 2023,True,"Our outbound flight was excellent with no issues and on 10 June for our return flight, I have one big issue and some niggles. For the whole flight, the cabin crew locked off one of the two available toilets. There was nothing wrong with it as the cabin and flight crew used it. Keeping a toilet exclusively for crew use is, in my view, unacceptable. The seat on the A330 is comfortable and I had the best 4 hours of continuous sleep I have ever had in the air. The food offering was, for me, poor except for the snack just after take off with the first drink service. It comprised a pack of five mini, savoury biscuits and a little tub of onion chutney to dip, both of which were delicious and very different from the nuts or pretzels others offer. On the outbound flight, we were offered the traditional juice or champagne prior to take off but no attempt was made to offer this on the inbound flight. The Asian-style beef at dinner had little of the Orient about it. I didn't try the dessert or either of the starters. IFE was available but very limited choice compared to many other carriers. Finally the complimentary wi-fi was somehow not available on this leg but you could pay. Outbound no problem a voucher was given shortly after boarding. Okay, quite a bit of whinging there, and apart from the very comfortable seat the only other positive was that despite delayed take off on both legs the plane arrive on time or a little early.

Aer Lingus,2,"""Never again will I fly Aer Lingus""",14th June 2023,True," We booked a ten-day tour of Ireland thru Trafalgar Tours. The tour started 19 May 2023. We wanted to arrive early and see some of Dublin before the tour started so we booked an Aer Lingus flight from Orlando Florida to Dublin on the 17th of May. Our flight was due to depart at 8:30 PM and arrive in Dublin at 9:30 AM on the 18th of May. (Aer Lingus Flt. 120). We were told that the incoming equipment had been delayed and that we would depart at 9:30 PM. The incoming aircraft arrived shortly after 9 PM followed by a fire truck! We were told we would depart at 10;30 then, 11:30. this went on till 2 AM on the 18th. They said the flight was canceled, but we would be boarded in the morning as soon as the aircraft was repaired. Imagine 300 people scrambling to get their checked luggage and make their way to the check in desk to get a hotel voucher (we found out that they booked the hotel rooms at 9:00 PM that night), madness. We got to the hotel at 4:30 AM. We had three hours sleep and returned to the airport to see if our plane had been repaired, it hadn't. we were told we would be boarding Aer Lingus flight 34 for Manchester, England at 5:45 PM. We arrived in Manchester at 7:20 AM on the 19th of May. Our connecting flight (Aer Lingus 3327) to Dublin did not leave till 5:45 PM that night. We arrived in Dublin at 6:40 PM. We arrived 33 hours late. We had paid for a hotel room in Dublin for the night of the 18 that we didn't get to use, and we missed the complete first day of our tour. We filed a claim with Aer Lingus for $ 600 each for me and my wife per EU rules. We also asked for $220 for the hotel room we had paid for, $174 for meals and $800 for the first day of the tour that we missed out on. They have offered us $147 in total compensation although they are responsible for our losses. Never again will I fly Aer Lingus or say a good word about them.

I was told very rudely, you have 2 options, sit in the airport for 17 hours until tomorrow or move to Dublin. But you will then have to have a 3 hour bus journey to Shannon. What is so frustrating is this is a very regular occurrence, receive no apologies, then was made sit on the runway for 2+ hours without being able to purchase so much as a chocolate bar. I have been running from gate to gate like a headless chicken and have has no time to stop for some food. I'm starving. ""No we cannot give you anything to eat/buy until we are in the air"". Waited ages for flight then bus to take off, rushed again, no toilet on bus or time to run to shop. No where to charge phone to arrange a lift. 3 hour cold bus journey starved after that. Awful experience, will never fly Aer Lingus again. Obvious lies all the time, excuses for everything that were not even good ones. We got a free plastic glass of water from a 2 litre bottle and at no stage when people complained did anyone say 'Sorry'. Ryanair has become the new Aer Lingus and Aer Lingus the new Ryanair. Lots of extras costs to be as a result. Aer Lingus will regularly cancel Heathrow to Shannon on a Monday if the flight is not full to save them some $.

Six hours before the flight, Aer Lingus cancelled BDL and had me fly out of BOS. I asked them to change the return flight to BOS since my car would be parked there. They said that would be another upcharge, which I refused. I requested a refund of the $500 since they didn't deliver what I paid for. They rejected the request. So on top of the $500, I had to buy an Amtrak ticket from Hartford to Boston to get my car and pay for two extra days of parking at BOS. This is unacceptable.

I had expected an exceptional level of service, comfort, and attention to detail. Regrettably, my experience fell far short of these expectations. when I received my meal onboard. To my dismay, I discovered a disturbing bug in one of the dishes. This discovery was not only highly unappetizing but also raised serious concerns about the hygiene and quality control standards. Such a glaring oversight in food preparation is simply unacceptable. What adds insult to injury is the complete lack of acknowledgment or apology from any representative of the airline. I was astounded by the disregard for customer satisfaction and the absence of any effort to rectify the situation or offer an explanation.

Aer Lingus,7,"""have concerns over the baggage fees""",4th June 2023,True, Aer Lingus – Flight E1 178 on 4th June 2023. Dublin to London Heathrow. I shall start this review by firstly referring to the online booking experience. While the website is clear the added on fees such as seat selection and charges for baggage leave a bitter taste. I was livid to see that some passengers brought aboard bags larger than the one I paid to have in the hold based on the online information. Boarding was not efficient as there was no priority boarding for needy categories of passengers. Moreover the person checking & scanning the boarding pass did not even make eye contact and was using her mobile phone with one hand while scanning boarding passes with the other! This is unprofessional and something I have not seen before! Most of the cabin crew had a low profile with the exception of one very hard working lady who went above and beyond to assist and elderly couple. It was nice that some announcements were made in the Irish language as well as in English. The flight arrived ahead of schedule and disembarkation was efficient but again cabin crew other than the same hard working lady were invisible. The flight was operated by an A320 neo. This was ideal for such a short but very busy flight. The captain made clear announcements and safety was taken seriously. I would use Aer Lingus again but have concerns over the baggage fees.,A320 neo,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dublin to London,June 2023,1,1,,1,,,1,yes

They lied and said they were on the flights when asked. We watched them unload them. We took photos of this. We had AirTags in our bags and were able to track. They constantly lied to us about them looking for them. They make you fill out a report and you never hear from them again. Through a third party we were able to have our clubs picked up, without the airline even knowing. The customer service staff is ignorant and unhelpful. Very unprofessional all the way the senior person who just couldn’t be bothered and didn’t care. There were 8 of us and this happened to 7 of 8. Worst flying experience.

Aer Lingus,2,"""over 12 hours of delay""",27th May 2023,True," Our flight from Chicago to Dublin was delayed and our connecting flight to Zürich did not wait in Dublin. No big deal, we thought. Usually airlines would route us to the final destination without much fuss. Not the case with aer Lingus. Aer Lingus doesn’t have relationship with most major airlines. So you are presented with very limited choices. Our best case alternative routing presented was over 12 hours of delay from the original time. We even asked for a direct connection the next day but they didn’t have flights to Zürich on Sunday. So the next flight was two days away. We took the alternate route they provided. We were not provided any compensation or voucher.  We had to take the checked bags out at Ireland and go through immigration to get the rebooking done and had to check in afresh again. They provided boarding passes only until Amsterdam and not to the final destination Zürich. The baggage tag was also to Amsterdam. I raised concern over that. The agent said we should collect our bags again at Amsterdam and recheck and collect boarding passes at Amsterdam at KLM counter. The flight to Amsterdam was delayed by two hours. When we reached Amsterdam, we had to go through immigration and collect the bags again. We did that and when we went to check in the bags, we were told that their system doesn’t show that we paid for the bags and we have to pay again. We paid for 30 kg check in bags. Due to Aer Lingus's fault, we now have to pay again for the baggage (55 euro) and an excess baggage fee of 75 euro. Not only that, we had to visit six different counters to get this issue resolved. We spent well over four hours going from counter to counter with kids and bags. Klm staff asked us to pay them and seek reimbursement from aer lingus. When we contacted aer Lingus via them WhatsApp business account, they asked to register a case at their website and provided a link. After filling out all the details meticulously, the form crashes with a server error. Wow.

Aer Lingus,1,"""our luggage has not been located""",23rd May 2023,False,"There are lots of choices when booking a flight. We happened to be celebrating a milestone wedding anniversary and booked a trip to Italy. The flight itself was fine. We arrived at the airport in Naples and were the only passengers on a flight of 300+ people to be standing at the baggage carousel when it shut down because all the bags had been picked up by the passengers except for us. Our bags were missing. So now we head over to the missing baggage window and fill out a missing baggage claim form. This is Sunday morning. We make our way to the hotel with the clothes on our back for a week long stay to celebrate our anniversary not sure where our luggage is. We are tired. We have been on two flights for 10 hours. We wake up the next morning and put on the same clothes we arrived in to get breakfast. Never mind that there are new outfits in our luggage that we purchased for this trip that are floating around somewhere. After calling Aer Lingus multiple times and being told our luggage is out for delivery, we logged on to their missing baggage website only to learn our luggage has not been located yet in spite of Aer Lingus agents lying and telling us on the phone our bags were on the way. Was this so we wouldn’t go out and purchase necessary items to change into to keep Aer Lingus lost baggage costs lower. We are now in our 3rd full day in Italy and Aer Lingus still stands by their claim that one bag is out for delivery, when the truth of the matter is they can’t specify where it is en route. This saga will probably continue for us long after we depart Italy in two days. To add insult to injury, Aer Lingus cannot tell us what is acceptable and necessary that we can purchase while we wait hopelessly for our luggage. Talk about being given the run around, reading from a computer screen that the bags are in route, escalating our calls to supervisors who only read the same script on a screen. My Advice to Everyone out there - DO NOT BOOK YOUR FLIGHT through Aer Lingus if you value the peace of mind that you are entrusting a company that values it’s customers and will make a sincere effort to correct an error in a timely and honest manner. Let’s face it, a lot of people are like us, we don’t travel all the time, we spent thousands of hard earned dollars, and to be in Europe for going on four days in the same skivvies we arrived in should not be tolerated by customers - so book with another airlines if you value peace of mind.",A330,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Naples via Dublin,May 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no

Although Aer Lingus are not always perfect, in my opinion they are one of the better and more reliable airlines today. They are reasonably quick to refund when there has been a problem, reasonably fair in their assessments of grievances and generally better at professional communication than most. There's definitely room for improvement but overall I am happy to spend money with them as I have seen they care about the quality of their services when it matters the most, i.e. when there has been a problem.",,Business,Premium Economy,Dublin to Geneva,May 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,yes

Airline flights cancelled, lack of full staff, the list goes on. So, for this summer expect a whole lot of cancelled flights. So lets look at what a cancelled flight looks like in this post covid era. First off you'll get a message that your flight is delayed. Ok, so we'll just hang out in the club lounge a little longer, have a bite to eat, a beverage and just relax. Maybe an hour later check on how the flight is going and oh my! The gate looks like a scene at a border crossing: Its humid, its hot, there are people laying on the ground, babies are crying. Real hell on earth...well back to club for me! Then 3 hours after our plane should have left they announce flight cancelled. I go the gate and again see a scene of human misery, that's passengers I'm talking about, not Aer Lingus employees, they've booked it for the exits and gone home (probably high-fiving each other with, 'great job today!'). So we are left to our own devices and somehow all wonder to check-in like zombies out of a horror film (and the babies are still crying). An hour passes (it's now 10pm and we have been at the airport since 3pm) and word filters down that our luggage is in baggage claim. Off we all go to pick up our luggage (picture zombies trudging with a suitcase (and I wonder how those zombies with babies picked up their luggage?) Again we are at check-in with no Aer Lingus staff. Finally at 11pm someone who is not Aer Lingus starts to sort through this misery and give us direction, hotel, call this number, etc. And now for the zinger, not once, not at any time did any Aer Lingus staff show any humanity for the 3 or 6 month old babies that were crying. I saw one mother patiently comforting her baby in stoic solitude, showing her character and instilling in her baby what true character is.

Aer Lingus,3,"""shoddy customer service""",18th May 2023,True," The security is amazing so quick it's almost worth the way you are treated on the flight, almost. Going from Dublin to LA we had a engine fault. Totally get it - it could happen to any good airline. We were trapped on the flight for one and a half hours before air conditioning could be turned on. Then we were freezing. After a two hour delay we were off. This was my first long haul with Aer Lingus post covid - a lot has changed. The bar came round once! What you are not told is there is no complementary wine with your meal just a tiny tiny cup of water. Luckily for me I ordered two drinks to see me through to past dinner. Food was OK - as soon as dinner was served the cabin staff disappeared and I mean disappeared! I found them all about 5 hours later literally hiding in the galley. I asked if I could purchase a bottle of water ( gone are the heady days when someone quietly came round the cabin asking if anyone required water on an 11 hour flight) no we have no bottles I was told. Some one took pity on me and gave me one from business class. As a walked back to my seat clutching my bottle other travellers gasped with cracked lips ""where did you get that"" that was going to LA on way back exactly the same issues only I told the line to buy water before boarding. We landed in Dublin to something described as a breakfast burrito (it was hell on earth) and to add insult to injury we were not even offered a coffee! Shame on you Aer Lingus, shoddy shoddy customer service - in case anyone is wondering it was a £750 ticket. This is definitely what I would call a no frills air line.

No drinks trolley coming round offering drinks throughout the flight, the only drink I was offered was with my meal. No duty free offered. No food came around until about one hour into the flight, it seemed as though they heated one meal at a time. Slow is an understatement. On our outward flight, of the 30 seats in business class, there were only 13 seats occupied, yet I still could not have the meal I wanted as they had run out? Food was bland and uninteresting. The staff seemed to be just doing as little as possible, not interested, not friendly at all to anyone really. Got a code for free wifi in Business Class, it did not work, so no free wifi. At JFK when we were boarding our flight, which was delayed by an hour and forty minutes, a ground crew member attempted to open the barrier to allow economy class ticket holders with buggy/prams to board before anyone else did, until another staff member told her that business class passengers should be boarding first. Apart from the roomy and comfortable seat, I felt like I was in economy.

But the biggest failure were the staff at Dublin airport. The ground crew was rude beyond imagination.  The woman at the gate yelled at me and others, ripped my boarding pass out of my hand and was really disrespectful. That was not what I was paying for.

When we arrived in Dublin for our transfer one of the family members was put on a completely different flight at a completely different time.

We were then told to head back to baggage collection to collect our cases, and proceed to check-in to arrange the hotel. This would have been straightforward if they hadn’t made us wait 2.5 hours to get our bags back. We then had to make our way to the hotel, most of that was guess work, only to find out our so called food voucher wasn’t available for use in any of the hotel restaurants. They tried to palm us off with either fish or curry in a separate room and it wasn’t being served until after 21:30. Travelling with children, this really isn’t a fair deal.

To make things even more hilarious, my friend was travelling on the Aer Lingus flight to Glasgow around the same time we were due to fly, they were 20 mins from landing and they turned back due to a technical fault.

Me and my wife flew back for a relatives funeral and upon or return Aer Lingus canceled our flight and changed our flight with out notifying us. I paid extra for a direct flight, almost double to be exact, and they forced me on a connecting flight to Hartford, Connecticut, and we had to get a bus from Hartford to Newark. I was told it was only going to take 2 hours and because it’s under a 3 hour delay they would not comp us on anything whatsoever. The supervisor at Dublin airport was not helpful, just had an attitude when I tried to explain or situation and would not give us any alternative flights.

Aer Lingus,6,"""a low-cost basic experience""",28th February 2023,True," There was nothing wrong with the flight itself per-se - it took off and landed on time, generally calm. Terminal 2 security at Heathrow was calm, although amenities and shops quite poor - since Boots closed, you can't buy water anywhere for less than £2 which is extortionate. Boarding felt a bit early, but we didn't take off at departure time as it was quite slow - this was because there was only one gate agent checking in everyone including premium passengers and those requiring assistance, although automatic gates were used. Seats were above average comfortable for short-haul, on the way our was old-style so more padding and quite comfortable but on the way back was slimline but fine for an hours flight time - strangely the seat pocket in front had been sewn up so no where to store small belongings, which felt a tad low-cost despite the premium prices charged for this flight. Cabin-crew weren't especially warm and friendly and seemed rather unmotivated, they did pass through the cabin quickly offering the buy-on-board snacks and drinks but no menu was offered and it was almost like it was just a formality and seemed a bit surprised or put-out that some people actually wanted any like my neighbour in my seat. Buy-on-board products didn't look good quality from looking online, felt very expensive for what they were in comparison to other carriers. My biggest issue though is Aer Lingus charge quite a premium to fly with them against the only other carrier they compete with between the two cities, so they're not anywhere near cheap - yet it feels like a low-cost basic experience. I think even a complimentary snack and some water is the least the should offer as their sister airline BA now do in short-haul economy given the premium charge. I would fly with them again only if they were the only better option as on this route.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Cork,February 2023,1,1,1,1,,,1,no
Aer Lingus,6,"""FAs were helpful but firm""",30th January 2023,False," Nothing to write home about. Seats were a bit cramped, food tasted bland, no free alcoholic beverages on my flight (which I had previously assumed was standard on trans Atlantic flights but maybe I am mistaken). FAs were helpful but firm, IFE options left some to be desired. We got these tickets for ~$400 less than the closest competitor however, so I suppose we definitely got what we paid for.

Aer Lingus,1,"""So unprofessional and unethical""",9th January 2023,True," I pay GBP412 for 4 passengers - Heathrow to Belfast - this fare includes 63 pounds for extra legroom seats and 112 pounds for 25kg checked baggage x 4. Aer Lingus can no longer provide this service - they booked us onto a British Airways flight but on the 'cheap' seats - with hand baggage only, to the value of approximately GBP150 pounds for all 4 of us. There were checked baggage options available as I asked BA and it still would have only cost 215 pounds compared to the 412 I paid Aer Lingus. Now Aer Lingus reuse to refund me the extra legroom and checked baggage fees. I have to pay again to BA to have 25kg checked baggage x 4 and extra legroom seats are now not available. They take your money, can't provide a service, refuse a reasonable request for refunds, book you on a third of the price seats/flight and pocket my change. Their terms and conditions are the seats/tickets are non refundable - I understand this however my seats / tickets with Aer Lingus are non existent so how do these rubbish non refundable terms and conditions apply to a non existent service? As you can imagine - they can't or WON'T answer that. Their email to me said an alternative flight or refund - I requested the refund and of course was ignored.

Aer Lingus,1,"""shockingly bad customer service""",8th January 2023,True," From the moment we purchased tickets, we had the most shockingly bad customer service. Be aware: you can do nothing online, including book or change seats and must call Customer Service for everything. They do not respond to emails, customer service is outsourced to overseas Indian or Eastern European countries where some do not speak English well enough to answer your query. They always say you have to email but you never receive a response (this after 24 emails over 3 mths and no responses). We flew business and they ran out of food. They offered economy meals. Flight attendants clearly did not like their jobs. The food (when you did manage to get any) was horrible and it was next to impossible to get a second drink, even water. Finally, we arrived in SFO to hear my husband's name called - they put my bag on the flight from Dublin but not his. We were leaving and checked through from Paris. They promised it would arrive next day, next flight. 10 days later it is still listed as tracking and in Dublin. We phoned several times to be told it was still in Dublin as far as they could see. We went several times to the airport and checked Lost Luggage -also finally went a 3rd day to see the same flight coming in and found a helpful man on security who phoned around. He left to go to an 'office' and came out with our bag. Fully tagged. It is still listed as 'being tracked'. We have contacted Aer Lingus to advise this but still listed as being in Dublin. .

Aer Lingus,1,"""still haven't received the refund""",19th December 2022,False, I was flying back to Raleigh from Spain on Aer Lingus with stops in Dublin and Boston. However when I got to Dublin Aer Lingus had a system failure so all their EU flights were canceled but they were still pushing out the flights to the US. My flight got delayed 3 times however we finally boarded but about 30-40 minutes after boarding and right when the air hostess were giving the safety instructions they got a call from the pilot and couple minutes later the Pilot announced that the flight couldn't take off because he would go over the amount of flying time he can legally complete. When the flight was canceled it was around 11 pm and they promised to give us a hotel and reimburse us for finding new flights. They did not find us new flights we had to find them ourselves and they didn't provide us with accommodations. I ended up sleeping on the floor of the airport over night and spent at least 30 hours in the airport because of this whole ordeal. To this day I still haven't received the refund or the reimbursement for finding a new flight and it is now 2.5 months later. I understand that they would have been understaffed and thrown off guard when the system crashed but no staff member that I talked to seemed like they wanted to help.

Aer Lingus,2,"""Wouldn't fly them again""",17th December 2022,True," My experience with Aer Lingus was not very good. The airline was a step above a budget airline. Here's what was average the seats, the onboard service, and the entertainment options. The airline meals were tiny and hardly filled you up. The wifi did not work on any of our flights. However, it was upon arriving in Dublin that our problems began. We had a three hour delay due to ""weather"" despite the fact that the sun was shining and there was almost zero snow or ice on the ground. It took hours for them to de-ice the plane which is the airlines responsibility. The ground crew never told any of the passengers what was happening or how long we could expect to be delayed. The zero communication was very frustrating. The short flight to London had no complementary beverages of any sort despite the long delay. On our return flight to the U.S., in the Gatwick airport there was a single gate agent checking in 80+ passengers. We stood in line for almost an hour. Why Aer Lingus? We almost missed our flight despite arriving to the airport two hours early. The airline's apps and online website never worked and we were unable to check in before we arrived to the airport which meant we were confined to the very last row on the plane.

That didn’t bother me at all but just thought I’d note that. The main problem was the constant delays. Sure there was a issue with ice when the plane was en route to Chicago so it got delayed which is understandable. However this delay was not made known to anyone on the flight and after the gate changing 3 times and 4 hours after the plane was supposed to take off did the counter staff arrive and make an announcement of the delay which would cause my partner and I to miss our connection on Aer Lingus as well to Portugal. I called customer service 4 times, waited on hold for a total of 3 hrs only to be hung up on all 4 times and told to call Alaska who we booked through, though each time Alaska told us Aer Lingus has to make the changes and Aer Lingus refused to make the changes when Alaska told us Aer Lingus had to do it.

Aer Lingus were very good about the cancellation and looked after us well though communication was not great following the cancelled flight. The cabin crew served the most awful food I have ever had on a flight. The chicken meal I asked for was only lukewarm and since I didn't want to risk being ill on my holiday I decided not to eat it. Later they served coffee, I asked a cabin crew member for sugar and he completely ignored me, I assumed he didn't hear me and repeated my request, he immediately said I am dealing with something in a rude and aggressive manner, I was so embarrassed, even the people sitting next to me remarked on him. We flew back to Ireland on the 28th October on the 18.55 flight. We got a cereal bar and orange juice for breakfast, my husband asked for coffee following breakfast and was told that the captain said coffee was not to be served due to turbulence!

I liked the new A321NEO to Shannon much more comfortable than the old 757. However the return was hell. We arrived at the counter at CDG to total chaos after waiting in line for an hour we got to to an agent a contractor (Swissport?) she told us we didn't have a reservation so I gave her our number she then said the BOS flight is cancelled. But I pointed out that the previous customer is on the same flight and they got passes for both flights. She then said our reservations were cancelled by Aer Lingus and we would have to make our own arrangements to get home. I asked for the duty Manager who told me the same thing and suggested I call customer service. I made her call customer service and she got us on a BA to LHR and AA to BOS the next day. But No hotel or meals. I had to find a hotel on my own using a tablet on airport wifi. When we got back I submitted a claim for EU261 Compensation with Aer Lingus on July 1 Ref #8333779. I got an Ack for this the next day and have heard nothing since although I have inquired of status several times by Email. eventually I got thru to someone who said they are still working on the issue and to expect to hear soon - this was on Sept 30-still waiting.

Aero Vip carries out the public service obligation connection between Funchal and the smaller Porto Santo airport located on the island with the same name. The outbound flight was on a vintage (1989) Jetstream 32 turboprop airliner with the return flight being on a slightly older (1987) Jetstream 31. In both cases the safety briefing was carried out by the first officer himself, as the plane does not have any FA on board. The outbound flight left right on time and touched down in PXO just 10/15 minutes later. The plane on the way back arrived late and we left PXO with some 30 minutes of delay, again reaching our destination in slight over 10 minutes. The planes’ interiors are quite worn out but overall the planes gave me the impression of being in a good mechanical shape. If you take this flight to reach the beaches in Porto Santo, as was my case, the whole flight is a really fun and unique retro-experience for aviation enthusiasts which unfortunately comes with a hefty price tag (150 EUR return).

I didn't receive any feedback, and support, help. It is very bad company. It is very bad service. I don't advise this company to everyone. They did not refund the cost of the tickets I could not use because of Aeroflot. Round trip and return tickets are independent of each other. This company cannot automatically cancel them this way.

Naturally I was very concerned about the safety of Aeroflot nowadays as they cannot legally get parts for most aircraft, but we got here.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,5,"""felt very rushed and unpolished""",30th January 2022,True," Aeroflot has set high standards of achieving a 5-star airline status and my expectations significantly increased as a result. Positives included a seamless upgrade from Comfort to Business at LHR, good Plaza Premium lounge, very good miles earning vs redeeming ratio. The A350 hard product is phenomenal, especially on a short London route, and the catering on this flight exceeded the expectations (usually poor hot meal, however, the 4 cheese pappardelle was very good). However, there are two drawbacks on Aeroflot. Firstly, I  dislike Aeroflot’s or SVO’s standard practice of parking planes at the literally remotest ramps possible in -6C and with ice covering the stairs. I understand there maybe logistics issues, but doing so to a premium-heavy flight like London and for their most luxurious widebody is just beyond logic. I am observing that the crew service on the A350 / B777 is poorer than on their other planes. It gave me a feeling that the crew were very much undertrained; as a result the service, although efficient, felt very rushed and unpolished.  I still believe that the Aeroflot Business Class is above any of its European counterparts from the overall package size view, and if one manages to upgrade for miles (amazing redemption value) like I often do, then this product is possibly the best business class. However, full-fare paying passengers might be disappointed, because, in addition to a cutting-edge hard product, for such money, you expect a hospitable and personalised staff service beyond the ‘just tick’ attitude.  Overall, is Aeroflot a good airline, yes. Is Aeroflot a 5-star level airline and is its business class worth paying a full fare, no.",A350-900,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Moscow,January 2022,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,2,"""the whole ticket was cancelled""",21st September 2021,True," I missed my flight due to a confusion with the flights in the airport (Moscow SVO) - when two flights of Aeroflot were scheduled to the same destination with a difference of approx. 20 minutes, but one of them was not shown on the departure board (for some unknown reason). As a result I missed my flight arriving 5 minutes late to my gate. Other passengers were at the gate before me and still were not allowed to the flight. When I approached the customer desk in Moscow with my issue of a missed flight I still had three more connecting flights left in my round trip ticket. They informed me that the whole ticket was cancelled. It took them months to respond after and no support was provided with regard to my cancelled flights. How about the so called bonus miles program? Apparently it's not even possible to spend them in any way if you haven't reached 3000 miles. So, some of my flights with Aeroflot were not even counted in the miles account even though I travel quite often.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,5,"""Overall, an okay experience""",12th September 2021,True," Flight quite uneventful, although the hard product on Boeing 777 needs to be refurbished: it is outdated and worn. Crew were okay, although they seemed very stressed and exhausted from servicing a booked-out 777, full of families and crying babies l (on a 3-hour flight), and service felt very rushed and inattentive at times. SVO Terminal C is beautiful, but crowded and full of bottlenecks, resulting in long queues at security and long walking distances. The Malevich lounge, though, is excellent. It is well-planned and has numerous comfortable seating with amazing tarmac views and, despite being severely overcrowded, it didn’t feel like it.

Drawbacks: B777-300ER in need of refurbishment (hopefully this is coming soon), very hard, wobbly, uncomfortable seats resulting in back pain, unaffordable internet, new terminal severely overcrowded (even worse than in the older Terminal D).

I liked the food well enough and appreciated having actual metal cutlery (though serving wine in a paper cup seemed a bit déclassé). The entertainment system had quite a wide variety of both movies and music. There was only one W.C. for a cabin of 50+ passengers, which is the only notable demerit that I found.

As tickets for alternative flights were being bought by other people and prices were rising very quickly, the only realistic option was to buy a new ticket from Aeroflot for a date before the closure of borders, and then claim a refund. The price of this new ticket was several times more expensive than the original ticket. Aeroflot have refused to provide a refund for the new ticket.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,1,"""The customer service was extremely poor""",2nd November 2020,False," My flight was cancelled by Aeroflot back in April. We called multiple times throughout April, May and June and I was promised a refund of the full amount. It was obviously not up to me whether to take that flight or not and it is reasonable to expect a full refund. However refund was never provided. I tried to send multiple messages to the airline’s customer service as well with no response. Last week I tried to call Aeroflot customer service. I had to pay for the international call as there are no representatives in Australia where I live. The customer service was extremely poor. To be honest, I have not encountered such poor attitude in years and it was extremely frustrating. The customer service representative could not properly address any of the issues. She said that the only two options are a voucher and reissuing new ticket. Well, I don’t live in Russia or even Europe so there is absolutely no way I can use these options. The reason why I bought a ticket with Aeroflot was that the transfer time was convenient on my way from Rome to Tokyo, I was not even intending to visit Russia. I explained it and no, nothing she was willing to do, just continued quoting new Russian legislation that came into effect half a year after I bought the ticket! I asked to explain how come I was promised a refund previously and was held waiting for months and months and now it’s not an option. She couldn’t explain. She said I can submit complain through the feedback section. I explained that I have tried to communicate the issue through the feedback section already and not getting any response. She said she can’t help with. Then I asked her to connect me to her supervisor and no, she couldn’t do it for some reason. This is the first time ever I couldn’t speak to a customer service manager or a supervisor. Basically the company just decided to keep my money that I paid, go ahead with it and customer service did not care at all. I just lost a lot of money on the international call without any resolution. This situation is absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable. Every other airline I booked with that cancelled flights provided me a refund a while ago, despite COVID-19. Understand there are struggles at the moment and I did accept a voucher from an Australian airline because I can use it living in Australia. But I just can't use an Aeroflot voucher. The ticket wasn’t a cheap ticket either and it was refundable and it is outrageous that I can’t get money back for a ticket that was refundable (and I paid a premium for it to be refundable and have an option to receive a refund). I sent another message to the airline following the call and received the same response about vouchers that is pretty much just their copy paste from the customer service templates. The airline does not care about their customers and reputation and is just exploiting COVID-19 situation to hold customers’ cash for as long as possible (if not indefinite).",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Rome to Tokyo via Moscow,April 2020,,,,,,,1,no

All were also immaculately attired and turned out. For a three hour flight, not overly long, they got in three services, a food run, then tea and coffee and duty free and made it look easy. I also loved the Sukhoi Superjet (SSJ100) despite all the stories about it. I chose to fly it deliberately, as I wanted to see for myself what it was like. Great little regional commuter. I found it very comfortable inside with ample leg room and a rear toilet that was huge - larger than on some big wide bodies. Plane was also very clean inside. No IFE but to be expected on short haul regional commutes and didn't phase me and didn't expect any. So my overall experience with Aeroflot from Bucharest to Moscow return, was outstanding and enjoyable and I can't think of anything to mark down.

At the transfer desk we tried to get the extra legspace.  During the flight there were many rows with the extra legspace free. I was not allowed to change seats. For the way back we managed it differently, we went again 24 hours before to the airport... no aeroflot desk.. For this flight back we managed it.

Lounge access. Fly Attendants very welcoming, helpful and genuine. Space + seat (front row) and economy seat with good width (18') and pitch (32') - Aeroflot is one of the very few Airlines to still give 18 inches width (most nowadays give 17"" or less). Moscow Airport is quite good, the various lounges for Frequent Flyers / business passengers are really excellent. Arrived on time and relaxed to Phuket. Had only once in 3 years a delayed luggage (was delivered 48 hours latter to my door in Paris, free of charge to me).

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,2,"""they are a pure disaster""",27th November 2019,True,"Aeroflot has two faces. When things run smoothly, they are okay, but when you have a problem with them, they are a pure disaster. I flew with my family from Asia to Sweden, via Moscow. Even though we had more than an hour of waiting in Moscow none of our luggage arrived with us in Sweden. We reported it. Aeroflot was extremely unclear about where and when the luggage would come, and they were unable to locate it, until it, different days, arrived in Sweden. It then turned out that one of our hard Samsonite suitcases had a hole in it. It was too big to be acceptable and I therefore made a claim to Aeroflot, in accordance with their procedure. They answered me that I should send original documentation to Moscow. I did so, but was careful enough to make copies of everything. A couple of days later they just closed my claim, without any further explanations. After that I have contacted them a large number of times, making new claims referring to the original one and so forth. When they noticed that I did not give up, they tried a new strategy – to not answer. After months of waiting, I contacted them again, and actually got an answer: that they had increased their own handling time, according to the Russian law (they said), with another 30 days. Then it was silent again. Next time I contacted them they told me to make a new claim, since the first one was not treated! When I said I did not want to they referred to the Swedish Aeroflot office, which in turn told me to send the claim to them. But when the Swedish office answered to my claim it was with the information that they would not handle the case. Indeed, I have to communicate with the Moscow office, they told me. Aeroflot clearly have no intention whatsoever to give me any compensation. If you think that your suitcases and luggage is not so much to care for, you could buy a ticket with Aeroflot, but if you have any luggage that has a value you should think more than once - and then use another air flight company.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Hanoi to Stockholm via Moscow,July 2019,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no

I was delayed due to the cyclone hitting South Korea at the time of the flight. However, the service and unfriendliness of the staff have left a bitter taste. We arrived at about 19:30. There was very little information provided. They were arranging a hotel to stay for the night, but could not announce that until 22:00. They then took the delayed passengers upstairs and left us there for a further hour with no information. They then collected us, but we then wait another hour until the coach finally came to take us to the hotel. Once at the hotel, they let us in, in small groups. We then had to be paired with strangers in one room, but that took forever. We finally made it into a hotel room at 02:00 with the flight scheduled for 05:55. They were arranging collection at 04:00, so with only 2 hours to rest, it was a terrible experience. The staff were apathetic toward all the passengers affected. They did not seem to care and just left us all confused and without information. The flights themselves were okay, but the staff were relatively unfriendly to me. I would not recommend Aeroflot.

Review covers SVO-JFK, SU100/24Sep as this was the best of the four flights. Ground staff in all cities are surprisingly professional. Flights board well in advance of departure and airplanes, when loaded, depart. Schedules are not padded for time and flight time is accurate. Premium Economy is excellent value with comfortable seats, decent amenities, and big, filling meals. The only alcohol served is beer and wine; drinks service is followed immediately with meal. Oddly, the second meal on both transatlantic flights is served 3 hours before arrival which interrupts the chance for some hours of sleep. Announcements are continuous and interrupting; first, pre-recorded Russian/English followed by crew Russian/English announcements repeating the same message. Crews are typical, ranging from disinterested senior to pleasant, willing, smiling junior cabin staff. Services SVO-TSE-SVO on Airbus equipment with no IFE are similar with nice food, disruptive announcements and decent level of comfort. SVO is sprawling, transiting without visa is easy but you cannot linger between flights due to crowds and distance. Aeroflot was ok .... on time, with good food and comfort.

For all the time in the queue there was not a single announcement about the beginning or end of check-in for flights, which I initially did not pay attention to, but which probably played a decisive role in what happened. Having pre-registered online, I did not manage to check in my luggage until the end of registration. When it was my turn, they suggested that I fly without baggage. As a result, my granddaughter, 14 years old, who had no luggage, flew out alone, while I reissued a ticket at the ticket office the next day (August 8), for which I paid 5520 rubles. In addition to me, other people with similar stories crowded around the ticket office and they all asked the same questions: “Why don't they announce the end of registration? Why are company employees working so slowly?” I want to ask one more question: ""Why do the tickets indicate only the time of boarding the plane, but there is no time to complete the registration?""

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,1,"""handled so poorly""",7th August 2019,True," New York to Tel Aviv via Moscow in June 2019. Worst experience I've had with an airline. My flight from JFK to SVO, was continually delayed by Aeroflot without explanation. Even though the boarding time was never changed, we boarded over an hour late, then were told to get off after 80 minutes sitting on the plane without any sort of communication from Aeroflot staff about what was happening. They eventually claimed that they were trying to solve ""mechanical issues"" with the plane while we continued to sit on the plane. As I later heard airport staff commenting on, I have no idea why they boarded all of the passengers when they had clearly not solved the issue to begin with. To make matters worse, despite the flight taking off from New York (with many American and English-speaking passengers on board), most of the announcements were only made in Russian. After we got off, we were told that we would need to wait for up to 3 more hours to be notified about the status of our flight. We waited for almost 2 more hours before they canceled the flight - but, in fact, they did not admit to canceling the flight - instead, they claimed to have ""delayed"" the flight for a full 24 hours! Many passengers, myself included, were upset and frustrated, but this was not the end of the complete botching of this flight by Aeroflot. They seemed to have no planned response to this scenario. They herded us all upstairs to claim our luggage, and then had us wait in obscenely long lines to check in with two Aeroflot staff members  to claim an updated ticket for the 24-hour-delayed flight and/or a hotel voucher. After already being delayed for hours, we had to wait on these lines for at least an additional 1-2 hours. The worst part of this whole disaster was that Aeroflot claimed that they were not rebooking anyone's flight because the flight had not technically been canceled, it had been delayed (according to them). Most reasonable airlines release tickets once a flight has been canceled (as this one effectively had been, clearly) so that passengers can rebook on other flights, but Aeroflot was able to get around that by ""delaying"" the flight.  The staff that were handing out the new tickets and hotel vouchers were quite rude and displayed no sympathy for customers who had been treated so poorly by the airline already (I understand they were dealing with many angry customers, but they still could have at least apologized on the behalf of the airline, which they did not). Sure enough, even though I had a program in Tel Aviv that required my presence before the ""delayed"" flight's arrival, Aeroflot would not rebook my flight. I was lucky enough to have a travel agent for this trip, and they were able to demand that Aeroflot rebook my flight to another airline after a lot of frustration on their part, requiring me to rush to another airport after a whole night of no sleep. The entire experience was handled so poorly and unprofessionally from beginning to end that I will never fly with Aeroflot again.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Tel Aviv via Moscow,June 2019,,,,1,,,1,no
Aeroflot Russian Airlines,4,"""my luggage did not arrive""",30th July 2019,True," Madrid to Guangzhou via Moscow. I would just like to say that the way this airline schedules this flight is a recipe for stress and disaster. A friend of mine flew the same route and had the same thing happen to her. She had given me a heads up that I would have to go from one end of the Moscow airport to the next end in order to attempt to make my flight. She also warned me that my luggage would probably not arrive. She knew this as she had taken the same route two weeks before I did. The flight from Madrid to Moscow flight 2501 arrives at 5:50 PM at terminal D. Then you have to get though security to get to terminal F in order to take flight 220 which leaves at 7:05 PM from gate 57 at terminal F, which is the second to the last gate. I literally ran from one terminal to the next and then asked the security attendant if she could take me to the front of the line in order to make my flight. If I had not ran and had not asked to be taken to the front of the line I would have missed my flight. Once I arrived in Guangzhou, I was told my luggage did not arrive and would be delivered the next day. So, why have a route so tight that will cause passenger's luggage to always arrive a day late? If the airline is going to keep this schedule, they need to at least warn passengers that their luggage will arrive late and warn them that if they want to make their connecting flight they need to RUN to make it on board. Why not make the layover time a bit longer and avoid so many problems?",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Madrid to Guangzhou via Moscow,July 2019,1,1,1,1,1,,1,no

As a Frequent Flyer (GoldMember) with Aeroflot for nearly 3 years, all I can say is that I'm very satisfied with them. Flight Attendants are genuinely welcoming and helpful, aircraft (usually Airbus) are recent, seats have a generous width & legroom (Frequent Flyers are entitled to a Space+ Seat with extra leg room, free of charge), food & wines onboard and in the business lounges are good and prices are overall competitive. You may sometimes have a flight delayed (snow at Moscow Airport in the winter, etc) - but I've experienced that Aeroflot will never let you down. They will provide drink, lunch, even hotel, and next available flight. A few months ago my flight from Bangkok to Paris was delayed, Aeroflot put me on the Thai Airways direct flight in the same day / evening and gave me a 4 star hotel + meals for the 8 hours waiting time. Moscow Airport is good, and has everything you need - restaurants, cafés, bars, hotels, wifi, vending machines. I had my luggage delayed - only once in 3 years - it was delivered to my door in Paris 48 hours later, free of charge to me. Overall a very good airline and I strongly recommend Aeroflot.",A330,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Moscow,July 2019,1,1,1,1,1,,1,yes

Traveling with 3 kids, they bumped me off my business class confirmed flight, without my consent and without a forwarding confirmed flight. 4 hours waited at the international ticketing desk, in an area with no water/food, with 3 young kids, since according to Russian law to enter the terminal you need to clear immigration and security. Requested/demanded to meet supervisor, was told by staff that they were in another building! Finally get into the terminal and then spend next 10 hours at another information desk in the terminal. With 3 kids this was absolutely one of the worst travel experiences, especially since I paid for business class to have the comfort. They finally put us up in one of the worst hotel rooms imaginable (available only at 10pm), with no ability to upgrade (since we were not in the ‘Russian section’ of the hotel). We were finally able to get out of Moscow the following day, 24hrs later. No response from Aeroflot customer service. Don’t expect one. Don’t think they care either. Just a piece of advice: shell out the extra $200 and get another airline into Delhi.

I have flown Aeroflot 9 times between Almaty and Copenhagen via Moscow in the last 5 months and my luggage has arrived on the same flight I have arrived on less than 15% of the time. Furthermore, it often does not arrive for 48 hours, which is incredibly inconvenient. And on the Almaty end, I have to go to the airport myself (or get a courier) to pick it up.

The staff was continuously smiling but that does not help. Aeroflot claims that they have a lost luggage tracking system but it doesn’t work. Calling customer support is pointless. I called like 20 times and I was every time disconnected while waiting on the line. The staff in Phuket promised to deliver bags tomorrow to our hotel.

Despite the A330-200 was full, the boarding speed was impressive. Most of travelers were Indians returning home, so it may have played a role, as I was among the very few required to show a visa to enter India. Plane is a bit old, but in good shape.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,1,"""beyond bad customer service""",27th June 2019,True," Last week my wife and son flew Aeroflot with a 1hr 20 min connection through Moscow Sheremetyevo. The flight from Almaty touched down in Moscow on time, but passengers had to wait 20 minutes for the terminal bus to arrive. The stewardess assured my wife that if the connecting flight was missed, ""they will give you seats on the next flight."" The plane was served by only one bus, so everyone had to wait for all passengers on the plane to disembark before the bus ever left for the terminal. Transit passengers in Terminal D must pass through a security and passport control check before entering the terminal. By the time my wife and son cleared the security check, the boarding gate for their connecting flight to JFK had closed. Nevertheless, they made all haste to the departure gate, hoping they would be allowed to board, but they were too late. Aeroflot agents told my wife that the missed connection was her fault and she would have to pay full fare for the onward journey, more than $1,700. My wife had only a little over $900 on her card. I transfered the money to my wife's card so she could buy her and my son's ticket. This kind of mistreatment goes far beyond bad customer service.

Our flight was scheduled to board at 11:20 am the next day, so at 8am we went to customer service and asked about getting our boarding passes printed. Again, we were met with staff who cared more about ignoring is then helping us. They told us to go to the gate at 11am, which we did, and it was chaos.

I am really curious why Aeroflot needs the phone support at all. The flight itself was not too bad. Most problems came from the fact that Sheremetyevo airport is extremely poorly managed, so both during inbound and outbound flight we had spent a lot of time burning fuel in the air waiting for a vacant slot.

The flight SVO-PEK was 1 h late in PEK as well, and I was put in Beijing in a hotel for 24 h to wait for the next Air China flight. My visit to ULN was planned as 2 days long, so I requested an Aeroflot agent to send me back to AMS, as my trip had lost its purpose.

Well, they were sitting right there in their storage room!

Aerolineas Argentinas,1,"""do not recommend choosing this airline""",18th September 2023,False," Our recent trip with Aerolineas Argentinas on the 6th, 7th and 11th was a deeply disappointing experience. Both on the way there and on the way back, we faced a series of problems that negatively affected our trip. On the way out, our scheduled flight to Buenos Aires from Guarulhos was scheduled to take off at 10:50 am. However, we were abruptly informed of a delay with no clear guidance on how to proceed. During the agonizing wait time, we received conflicting information about departure times, and promises of meal vouchers were not fulfilled on time. This forced us to spend our own money on food. To make matters worse, our flight was ultimately cancelled, and we faced difficulties in reaching Aerolineas employees for clear information. After an exhausting wait, we finally received a voucher for a hotel. However, the instructions for finding the bus to the hotel were confusing, and company staff seemed to be disrespectful of our situation.  Upon arriving at the hotel, we discovered that Aerolineas Argentinas had only paid for the outward ticket, leaving us with unexpected expenses for the return to the airport. The following night, we faced another long queue at the airport and missed our connection to El Calafate, without any hotel paid for by the company. We were instructed to request accommodation at a hotel in Buenos Aires, but were only given a voucher for breakfast at the airport. This resulted in an extra 10 hours of waiting at the airport, putting a damper on our planned tour. On the return trip, we faced an additional problem, as the stopover in Córdoba was not informed on the ticket, resulting in a 1-hour delay upon arrival in São Paulo. In short, our experience with Aerolineas Argentinas was highly unsatisfactory due to delays, cancellations, lack of clear communication and inadequate support from the company. We do not recommend choosing this airline for future travel.  Nossa recente viagem com a Aerolineas Argentinas nos dias 6, 7 e 11 foi uma experiência profundamente decepcionante. Tanto na ida quanto na volta, enfrentamos uma série de problemas que afetaram negativamente nossa viagem. Na ida, nosso voo programado para Buenos Aires a partir de Guarulhos estava marcado para decolar às 10h50. No entanto, fomos informados abruptamente de um atraso sem orientações claras sobre como proceder. Durante o tempo de espera angustiante, recebemos informações conflitantes sobre o horário de partida, e promessas de vouchers para refeições não foram cumpridas a tempo. Isso nos obrigou a gastar nosso próprio dinheiro para alimentação. Para piorar, nosso voo foi finalmente cancelado, e enfrentamos dificuldades para encontrar funcionários da Aerolineas para obter informações claras. Depois de uma espera exaustiva, finalmente recebemos um voucher para um hotel. No entanto, as instruções para encontrar o ônibus para o hotel foram confusas, e funcionários da companhia pareciam desrespeitar nossa situação.  Ao chegar ao hotel, descobrimos que a Aerolineas Argentinas havia pago apenas a passagem de ida, deixando-nos com despesas inesperadas para a volta ao aeroporto. Na noite seguinte, enfrentamos outra fila longa no aeroporto e perdemos nossa conexão para El Calafate, sem nenhum hotel pago pela companhia. Fomos instruídos a solicitar alocação em um hotel em Buenos Aires, mas recebemos apenas um voucher para café da manhã no aeroporto. Isso resultou em 10 horas extras de espera no aeroporto, prejudicando nosso passeio planejado. Na viagem de volta, enfrentamos um problema adicional, já que a escala em Córdoba não estava informada na passagem, resultando em um atraso de 1 hora na chegada a São Paulo.

Aerolineas Argentinas,6,"""they tend to leave on time or early""",20th March 2023,True," One of the best things about AR is that they tend (in my experience on 3 flights) to leave on time or early. Boarding by zones is usually enforced and it works; boarding starts early. Staff on board seem tired, are never well-groomed and generally bored. Friends / other staff seem to be upgraded to Business class regularly on board. Catering is very basic usually - example: ""Breakfast"" flight of 3.5 hours, leaving at 05:10 served a cup of still water and a small ""health"" bar. No options like other menu for sale items. Crew disappeared after service. Cabin baggage seems to have no item number control but is weighed rigorously. Free checked baggage allowance is 15kg, unlike most other carriers throughout the world, and carry-on is 8kg. This can be a trap for international guests who usually travel with around 23kg checked baggage allowance.

Aerolineas Argentinas,1,"""still haven't received my money""",10th February 2023,True," Worst experience with an airline, ever! Completed booking, completed payment with my bank and got forwarded back to a website that said ""error"". No confirmation, no tickets received but the money was gone. Called with customer service and got disconnected a total of 6 times while being on hold. When I finally did speak to someone, she informed me there was a booking with reservation number but something on their side went wrong with the payment. She gave me the reservation number and on their website I could find my flight details. But still no tickets. I had to e-mail the ventasonline department who would be able to provide me the tickets. The communication with ventasonline was pointless. They first told me my booking didn't exist and I should book a new flight. I showed them a print screen of my bank payment and the booking with the reservation number and then it all of a sudden did exist, they would write me back about a solution for the money or tickets but they never did. Called with customer service again and they would all say something different or that I had to call back in an hour so they would know more. Did that a total of 4 times when I just lost my patience and the only thing they told me I could do was write an official complaint. As a reply, I received an automated e-mail telling me to contact customer service, so basically super pointless and you're just going around in circles with no one knowing how to help you get either your money back OR give me the damned flight tickets. I always book direct with an airline so that this stuff doesn't happen, but Aerolineas Argentinas apparently doesn't care about their clients and actual customer service. It has been 3 weeks now since booking and still haven't received my money. They tried to make me book a new ticket before receiving the money back but of course I don't have any trust with them anymore so booked with another airline (Air France) and everything went fine. This was my first experience with Aerolineas Argentina and for sure my last. Will avoid flying with them at all costs. By the way, because I paid with credit card my money is safe. I got confirmation from my bank and credit card provider that I was in my right and would receive money back via them.

We paid business so you mean to tell me there’s even more of a price for seat choice even when you can’t see it online?)

On arrival in Buenos Aires we had 59 minutes to check which terminal our onward flight was departing from and make our connection. No assistance of any kind was given by Aerolineas staff.

No video, cramped seats, no food even for sale, no beer or wine for sale (this in a country where wine is everywhere). The plane looked and felt dated and worn. Service is indifferent. By contrast, we flew them many years ago where food and beer/wine was complimentary. They have made a decision to go cheap, and it shows in virtually all aspects of the experience of enduring their product. In the US, this would be like flying Spirit, or in Europe, this would be like flying Ryanair. Yes, it is that bad - and I am not prone to exaggeration. At least Spirit and Ryanair don't pretend to be full-service airlines. Aerolineas does, which makes this is even more infuriating. Like I said, virtually all the domestic routes in Argentina are via Latam and Aerolineas. On top of that, almost all the flights go through Buenos Aires city airport (which is actually quite nice). But that means you will have a layover if you are going from one city to another within Argentina that does not include BA.

For a three hour flight, only a snack mix packet was served. Check in is very fast, boarding passes printed almost immediately, but the lines are long and people seem to turn up very late for their flights often, which means a lot of queue cutting. Boarding is mostly a mess, but bearable. Compared to LATAM’s lines though, Aerolíneas’ lines are relatively short. The 737MAX I flew was amazing. The engines were extremely quiet and the windows were large and gave a great view. The seat is the same as China Airlines. Legroom reasonable for short flights. One thing I am critical about, is that overhead bin space is very scarce. People sometimes have to store stuff 3-5 rows in front or behind them.

We have travelled extensively two to three trips each year and never had a 15kg limit. The airline should have specified the limit if it was below the norm and offered the passenger the option of carry on if over limit at check in.

Aerolineas Argentinas,1,"""Avoid this airline!""",11th May 2018,True," San Luis to Buenos Aires. Avoid this airline!  Flights from San Luis to Buenos Aires were cancelled throughout the day blaming ""meteorologic conditions"", even though there was nothing unusual and flights were flying everywhere else with no problem. Customers were advised about the cancellations just minutes before the flight departure (via email), leaving everyone in limbo. When calling customer centre, they were very rude, and said that the tickets did not qualify for reimbursement, only could be rescheduled for another day. Of course, they wouldn't pay accommodation or anything else either. When trying to discuss options with them, they simply hang up. Finally, many passengers opted to take the bus and claim the money later on (good luck with the claim, anyway). Unfortunately, they have the monopoly of many flight routes in the country and there is no competition, so they charge whatever they like for a very poor service. They not only cancel flights with no notice, half of the time there is a strike or some other reason to leave people stranded.

This was a return section and my travelling with Aerolineas after some years. I've read some bad press and I recall long haul on dilapidated 747's and 737s 10 years ago. This was a short 1.5 hr flight but international never the less. I require assistance now and this airline provided it with care to attention and in a dignified manner. Check in is good, you receive an email 24 hours prior ""looking forward to seeing you"" and even a slightly overweight bag was checked in with a wink. How contrasting to my recent Norwegian experience at LGW. Nice clean plane, welcoming well groomed cabin crew along with a standard seating plan. Basic but complementary snack served by very pleasant crew who didn't seem to struggle with English. On time and disembarking with assistance well managed.

The Austral flights were actually better - the Embraer planes are more comfortable and roomy than Aerolineas Argentinas 737s (which looked new but were a bit cramped) and the Embraer seats even have small entertainment screens (can be hard to get earphones though).

My initial flight with the company was okay, if nothing to write home or review about; however my attempted trip back was horrible. The flight was cancelled. I received only a notice the late night before with no explanation. I had no way of getting information as it was a weekend and they do not have weekend hours. When I went to the airport I was informed there were no flights due to a strike. Now while this may have effected more than one airline they did not offer a refund or remedy, or even an apology or sympathy for their clients. I was one of the lucky ones that got in before they left at 2 pm and basically every other passengers had to learn via word of mouth why and how long (5 days before reschedule) they had to wait.

Aerolineas Argentinas,1,"""the worst I've come across""",15th December 2017,True," I flew Aerolineas on a two week trip with my family from JFK --> Buenos Aires --> Bariloche --> Mendoza --> Buenos Aires --> JFK. I was always a little annoyed with them. I waited on the phone for 30 minutes the day before my flight to reserve seats for the flights and when I showed up to the airport they had no record of my phone call (even though I had gotten an email with seat confirmation) and they had already given away our seats. Given that we had an international flight on our itinerary, we were entitled to two checked bags for each of our flight legs, and every single time they tried to charge us and we had to remind them that we got two free bags - I think they were trying to dupe us. What was most frustrating was that they cancelled our flight home with just over 24 hours advance notice because of a ""technical difficulty"" with the plane, and instead of having the direct flight from Buenos Aires to JFK that we paid for, they re-booked us (after 1 hour on hold) on a flight to New Jersey. I had a connection from JFK to Boston that I obviously missed, and ended up having to pay for another very expensive flight. I filed a claim and never heard back. I called once to follow up and after 45 minutes on hold I was promised that all claims were addressed within 22 days. 22 days came and went and I never heard back again. I made four additional follow-up phone calls, and each time I was on hold from anywhere from 10 to 45 minutes before I could speak to someone. Every person I spoke to gave a different explanation - from this is the wrong phone number to claims take 2 months (not 22 days) to call Expedia. When I finally started asking to speak to supervisors, two times I was actually hung up on. It is ridiculous that I paid for a flight to JFK, they cancelled it, offered me a flight to another airport, and when I declined, I can't get my money back.

On the first of these flights, I managed to miss my flight after not hearing the announcement of a late change in the boarding gate. Totally my fault, but Aerolineas put me on the next flight straight away with no extra charge. So had a good first impression of them. The staff all had decent English (which can be rare in Argentina), the interior of the planes are very spacious when compared with what I'm used to from European airlines and the in-flight services were great. Only downside is that the air-fares are higher for non-Argentinian citizens. But that's a common trend in the country.

No complaints whatsoever, brand new, clean planes and enjoyable service both on the ground and in the air. Complementary catering absolutely sufficient for a 3 hour flight with 2 ham/cheese sandwiches, soft drinks and coffee on offer. The only inconvenience was that my reservation number (ticket issued by Lufthansa) wasn't recognized by AR, hence I was unable to make online check-in and reserve seats for the GIG-AEP leg upfront.

Aerolineas Argentinas,3,"""I expect friendly service""",30th August 2017,False," Flew Buenos Aires to Miami. Has to be the worse product flying from South America to the US. Here's why: Product - dated angle-flat seats on a 2-2-2 set up. Most seats were worn out and clearly hadn't been cleaned in a while. Amenity kit very basic and neither the bag or products were branded (vs Coke Hann on AA, Tumi on Delta, Ferragamo on LATAM etc) Food - much less than basic. On the return I was better off having a quick meal at the airport than on the plane. Service - here's my major concern, if I'm paying a lot for business class, I expect friendly service and attention to detail. Anything I wanted I had to ask for it, they would take my glass of wine while they were still half empty and wouldn't ask if I wanted a refill. I had my food tray done for a long time before they picked up Entertainment - basic, ~30 movies (most of them old or Argentinian films). Forget about noise cancelling headphones. Overall impression: I would definitely avoid Aeroloneas as much as I could. I decided to fly with them since I'm a Delta Diamond and wanted to get them miles and Delta only has an overnight flight from ATL to EZE This airline is way overdue for a makeover.

Also, our flight was cancelled last minute because of a strike but no information was given to us until the day before. The first plane to fly back to Buenos aires was 4 days later and it was too late for us.

The domestic flights were on brand new Embraers with 1x2 seating and ample pitch. Based on this experience, the airline seems to have the basics really pulled together. The only disappointment was the catering. Dinner on the way down was served sloppily (congealed olive oil, no s&p, cling wrap on the dishes) and really unappetizing. And what's with the generic and generically tasting ""red or white?"" wine service? Shouldn't the flagship airline of this wonderful wine country take some pride and feature the best of their production?

When we said the other person said a different amount they said that this person did a mistake. They had 4 flights before ours and they couldn't have the small gesture of moving to any of them for a reasonable amount.

Business lounge in Buenos Aires was below average. The one supplied in Rome by Alitalia was superior. Outbound, they left one of my bags in Rome but arrived the following day and a zip was damaged which was very promptly and efficiently repaired at no cost. On the way back it felt like a child care facility with four seemingly unaccompanied children two of whom were visited by a member of the cabin - this type of freebie does not go down well when we have paid a full fee.

Just the night before this strike, the airline sent an email confirming flight departure date/time, knowing that the flight would be cancelled due to the strike. At the airport the airline did not provide any support at all to the thousands of passengers affected. All the information provided was that we needed to wait until 1pm to find out what was going to happen with our flights. The airport was a mess of people everywhere. At 1pm when the staff returned to work, all passengers were told to call a toll-free number to get support, no staff at the airport offered to help passengers at all; the toll-free number was congested with calls and there was an automated message asking people to call again the next day - how is that possible when people had flights to take to get back home or to reach a destination where hotels or other items had already been paid. The only reason why we were helped was that we complain so much and remained at the check-in window requesting somebody to help us with our flights, we had to ignore the negative treatment by some of the staff and their management and just held our position until someone decided to help us and put us on a flight - we arrived to our destinations after losing 1 day on our holiday; and upon our return discovered that after that whole situation Aerolineas Argentinas cancelled our return flights which had nothing to do with the original flights impacted by the strike. Once again we found ourselves at the Ushuaia airport being told we had no flights, having to deal with very poor attitude from the airline staff at the check-in counters, but repeated our behaviour as on the first flight and told the staff we would not move until somebody helped us as we had nothing to do with the cancellation of our flights.

I flew from Rio de Janeiro to New York with a long stopover in Buenos Aires and a switch of airports in that city. Rio de Janeiro to Buenos Aires (Aeroparque): Aircraft used was a fairly new Boeing 737-800, flight was on time, crew was friendly, decent leg room and the food provided to us was very good (nice sandwich with a traditional argentine alfajor cake) and a good choice of beverages. Nothing really to complain about this flight. Buenos Aires (Ezeiza) to New York (JFK): Aircraft used was a brand new Airbus 330-200. Very modern plane with LED ambience lighting, good entertainment screens with a good selection of movies and music. Sounds great so far right? Well, the downfall begins with the amount of leg room Aerolineas Argentinas have on this plane. I take long haul flights at least 3 times a year and have had experiences with various airlines but I have never seen a plane with such little space as this one. It was really uncomfortable the whole time because of the limited leg room (I am 1,79 cm). Unlike my other flight on this trip with Aerolineas, the food served for dinner was horrible, I didn't eat it at all, worst food I have ever seen on a long haul flight and I heard other passengers complaining about it as well. Breakfast was decent but still overall very disappointed.

When calling Aerolineas Argentinas, in order to find out the reservation code I should use for making the check-in on-line, after a very long wait I ended up talking with the most rude agent I’ve ever encountered.

Furthermore, she accused me several times during the call for interrupting her, when I simply tried to explain to her that all I wanted to know was the reservation code that they must have for my reservation in their system.

Aerolineas Argentinas,7,"""biggest criticism was check-in""",3rd April 2016,False," I recently flew from Bogotá to Buenos Aires and back on Aerolineas Argentinas. I was not sure what to expect, because reviews are very mixed. Both stretches were flown on their A340. On the outbound route, the seats were very old/outdated, although reasonably comfortable. The in-flight system was very limited with just 4 movies and not the best. On the inbound flight we had a different plane and the seats looked much better, although overall they were the same type, but the video screens were much larger. There was also a bigger choice in movies. On both flights the cabin crew was very attentive and pleasant. The meals, although quite abundant, were mediocre in taste, and in both cases, something or the other was forgotten (like the dressing). Bread was cold and/or stale. My biggest point of criticism was the check-in. I had a carry-on weighing 12.3 kilos. First at the counter in Bogotá they made a big fuss over size, but this particular TUMI bag does fit maximum accepted standards. They insisted I fit it in the thing to measure it and when they saw for themselves it did meet size requirements, they insisted to weigh it and told me to either take out the 2.3 kilos or have it checked. This when on Copa and Avianca they let me take it in on board in Economy, no questions asked, and this was business! On the inbound flight they had 3 counters in Buenos Aires with SkyPriority signs, but all 3 were unstaffed. The last check-in agent just walked away with leaving passengers in the SkyPriority line without saying anything. When I complained to the girl who did check me in at an economy counter, she said I had arrived just during a schedule change (how weird!). All in all it was a mixed bag with the actual flight a much better experience than the experience on the ground. To me their way of dealing with business class passenger in the check-in procedure leave much (!) to be desired. They did not treat us special, on the contrary. It was fussy to say the least.",A340,Family Leisure,Business Class,EZE to BOG,March 2016,1,1,1,1,1,,1,yes

My suitcase was 18kgs but the ground stewardess told me that I don't have to pay for it, 18kgs is no problem at all.  I reserved a window seat (5F) and when I came to that place, only 5D was available. My neighbor was a crying baby. In that moment I thought that this was going to be a worse flight. Then a man came to me if I wanted to change seats because he was the father of the crying baby. So: yes please. Still no window seat and I tried to explain that it was rude to take my windowseat, but I don't think he understood.

When the seat in front of you is reclined, you have the tray table pitted against you stomach, even if you are not fat. The flight attendants should ask everyone to sit upright when serving meals on the A330. Rows are so close that it is impossible to get up from your seat normally. One must slide to the end and climb out. I have flown this aircraft before and they are all the same in Economy - horrible. Considering how packed the flight was, the flight attendants were excellent. The food was mediocre with two choices: pasta or beef, and very small servings.

Aerolineas Argentinas,2,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,5th July 2015,False,"Flight was delayed 1 hr due to late arrival from Buenos Aires. I used Alitalia Lounge in Terminal 3, modern, large, with limited food options (salads, sandwiches, desserts).

Seat was ok, not full flat, but quite comfy. IFE very poor, only 5 channels available, showing only 2 movies in Spanish/English version, no Air Show with a map available, so had no idea about flight time etc. Cabin crew were nice and smiling, quite senior and during breakfast service, looking very tired and grumpy. Disappointing menu - I was expecting some local dishes from Argentina, some beef etc, and I got green salad with parma ham, risotto or pork with ratatuille or ravioli. I tried first two - all tasted the same, bland, boring, over cooked. No cocktail service at all, as only whisky is available. Good wines. Service in business class is very old fashioned, reminds me service from the 90s, nothing modern as for plating, food presentation, menu etc. Dirty toilet in Business Class.

I am 5'5 and was also uncomfortable. It was a long flight almost 9 hours and the TV screens did not function properly. Mine had no image whatsoever. My husband's screen had image but no sound. No entertainment at all for almost 9 hours is ridiculous. We had to take a second flight from Buenos Aires to Bahia Blanca and the flight was delayed 2 hours. On our return from Buenos Aires to Miami the flight was also delayed this time for 1 hour.

Well I'm happy to report that with Aerolineas Argentinas you don't ""get what you pay for"" you get much more.

We had the full Monty flying Aerolineas. But the staff handled us well. Flight out left on time but no accommodations for Sky Priority passengers. Charge the gate at JFK was more like it. The food was very good. Service is prompt in that every flight attendant worked to get the job done so they could disappear. We liked how they gave us 3 options for our meals. The ice cream for desert and/or cheese plate were fantastic. And it is true they don't offer mixed drinks. For water they gave us a bottle for the over night flight. Breakfast was again very prompt well presented and the crew when prompted did go the extra step. On the return our child's vegetarian meal was missing. The crew promptly reviewed the menu and told us additional items we could choose from. For the return our flight was changed to add a stop at BRC. At which time we were notified our return to JFK was delayed from 11 pm to 6 am. Sky Priority line did nothing to help us here. We had to suffer with the rest. However they did rebook our last segment with Delta for us and effectively communicated to the crew in JFK to assist us and they did! They offered us a hotel and dinner in EZE. As we missed our JFK connection back to MSP they put us up in NYC and paid for dinner there as well. We turned down the offer for the hotel room in EZE and were able to sleep in the Club Condor Lounge. This is easily better than most First Class Lounges I have seen. Aerolineas in my opinion did much more than Delta United or American would have done for us. Our kids got to spend time touring NYC for the night. Our only downside was the plane could have been cleaner. Sad for a new A330-200. Here the domestic carriers do a better job.

A small snack was served by very friendly cabin staff and all was well until the beverage cart rolled by and we asked for some Malbec wine and were told that Aerolineas do not serve wine on domestic flights!

Aerolineas Argentinas,2,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,26th August 2014,False,I flew MIA-EZE-MIA round trip on Aerolineas Argentinas (AeroA) December 24 2013 returning January 7 2014. I bought the ticket online but their website is not set up to allow you to select your seat. So I called their 800 number in the US. I called for 3 days several times each day before someone answered the phone. This agent's English was so bad it took 20 minutes to select my seats. EZE airport check-in at Buenos Aires is chaos. On AeroA all passengers for the MIA flight stood in a single line to be checked-in for only that flight. The same for other flights. We found this out by asking other passengers what to do as there were no AeroA employees or announcement boards present. There were long long lines of passengers snaking through the terminal. Check-in was so slow we were concerned we would miss our flight even though we arrived 2 hours early. It didn't matter though because our flight was delayed 3 hours on a crystal-clear morning. When we arrived at MIA 3 hours late the AeroA gate agents had gone home and there was no one to help us with rebooking our connections to Chicago. The planes both ways were run-down and old on the inside. On the way down a ceiling panel rattled the entire 9 hours. The entertainment system did not work either direction. The flight attendants only appeared 4 times in 9 hours: to serve drinks after takeoff to serve and collect dinner serve and collect breakfast and hand out immigration and customs forms. My advice: 1) Do not fly Aerolineas Argentinas for any reason even if you have to change your travel plans to avoid them or pay more on another airline. 2) If you are unlucky enough to use them and have to fly out of Buenos Aires EZE airport arrive 3 hours early and prepare for the slowest and most disorganized check-in procedure you have ever experienced. 3) If you do not speak Spanish then you will receive only limited customer service on the phone and their web site is primitive. 4) Prepare yourself for old tatty airplanes with no working entertainment system and largely-invisible flight attendants.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,,1,,1,no

Two options are for the breakfast time. The whole experience with the catering was horrible. From the presentation to the quality the food did not respond to a business class. Do not expect to have any cocktails since they only have wine beer and whisky. The dessert was a piece of rock (ice cream) and we received hard croissant and bread in our breakfast.

On our plane to Buenos Aires none of the in-flight video worked for the entire flight. There was a loose panel in the ceiling over an aisle and it rattled the whole 9 hours. The food was mediocre even by airline standards. The flight attendants were businesslike but disinterested. The plane was only about 1/2 full but the FA's were often nowhere to be seen. Our flight back was 3 hours late leaving EZE after a chaotic check-in at the filthy Ezezia airport. At Ezezia you do not stand in one line for all flights and go to the next available agent. Instead there are separate lines for each flight no indication of which line you should stand in and the agents appear when they feel like it. There was no explanation for the delay and no apologies.

There is no online check-in option for this flight and no seats are allocated prior to check-in so though you should only need to be there 2/3 hours before for an international flight I actually was told to get there 4 hours before just to get a decent seat and even then I queued for nearly an hour to check-in. Boarding was smooth and uneventful. The plane was clean but old. The in-flight entertainment system is horrendous. Considering this is a 15 hour direct flight there is no seat-back entertainment system. There is one large monitor at the front of the cabin and a few smaller ones spaces sporadically. The picture quality is terrible obviously no option to select subtitles if you are not a Spanish speaker. The movies were the same two films on repeat for the 15 hours. Nothing else. The food was adequate though the ran out of some food options leaving my companion to eat vegetarian or nothing else. Obviously the wine is good - it's Argentinean - but the drinks are just served with meals. If you press your call button it is ignored and switched off. I gave up trying to get some water. Breakfast was terrible none of it was edible. Flying back EZE-SYD was not much better. Check-in was a little easier and fortunately this time I managed to get a window seat. Upon boarding I discovered the plane was not full so I had two seats to myself. The only good thing to happen on this flight. The food was just as bad the availability or lack thereof of drinks was the same as before. The toilets were filthy and were obviously not checked or cleaned during the flight. The call-buttons were again ignored. The entertainment system was the same again this time they showed two English language films with Spanish subtitles a slight improvement but still the same on repeat for 15 hours.

Just a horrible airline, never again will I use it.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Guadalajara to Puerto Vallarta,October 2019,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no

Now the screen reads Viva aerobus to Puebla at 19:00. Still no staff and still no explanation.

Aeromar,1,"""never fly with Aeromar again""",22nd November 2018,True," Puerto Escondido to Mexico City. Aeromar is usually my airline of choice. On this day they were more than 2 hours late. So by the time I landed at Mexico City, got off the plane, got my luggage and got to the ticket counter of Aeromexico, my next flight was taking off towards Los Angeles. I thought that Aeromexico / Delta would just put me on the next flight. First, they made me visit different ticket counters which took another 45 minutes and at the end said that they couldn't do anything about it and I would have to buy a whole new ticket. The first ticket that I bought online cost me about $125 usd, but now this new ticket to LA cost me almost $300 usd. After I bought my ticket, went to the Aeromar ticket counter, which was in total disarray, and tried to talk with the supervisor. He gave me an email to write to and sent me on my way. Since then I wrote them twice and have received discouraging emails. Yesterday it took me two hours on the phone with them, going through 3 levels of management for them to give me a ""courtesy flight"" worth $80 usd and I still have to pay the tax. I ask them what would of happened if my whole family was with me, we would have spent $3,000 usd? He said that there is nothing that they could do, so much for customer service. So that is why I think I will never fly with them again.  In the old days we had no choice, but now there are 3 more airlines here in Puerto. There it is guys, the reason why I might never fly with Aeromar again.",,Family Leisure,First Class,Puerto Escondido to Mexico City,October 2018,1,1,1,1,,,1,no
Aeromar,1,"""such bad customer service""",6th November 2018,True, Oaxaca to Mexico City . I have never experienced such bad customer service. People had been in line for over 2 hours. Only 1 desk agent. Instead of calling people up front for the flight that was going to depart he checked in people for the flight after. Then gave us boarding tickets when the plane was already gone. People waited for 2 hours to find out what to do next. This airline is a joke! We got booked on a flight the next morning resulting in a loss of paid hotel in Mexico city. When we arrived the next morning there were again 50 angry people in line waiting for a flight that Aeromar cancelled and didn't tell anyone. When we finally got on the plane multiple people had the same seat number. It was ridiculous and unprofessional.,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Oaxaca to Mexico City ,November 2018,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Aeromar,1,"""strongly advise against""",3rd June 2018,True," I paid $365 for a direct flight from Oaxaca to Tuxtla Gutierrez in Mexico. This airlines baited and switched me by canceling the direct flight and they changed the ticket to Aeromexico with connecting flights and a longer trip that I can now by for $158. They would not refund the flight and i unfortunately booked it with Priceline (who has the worst customer service in the known universe), so I received no assistance whatsoever and options that were not properly explained to me. When I phoned Aeromar, I was greeted by a completely rude agent who was less than helpful. I would strongly advise against booking anything with this airlines.

Aeromar,1,"""nothing has been resolved yet""",27th January 2018,True," Ixtapa Zihuatanejo to Acapulco via Mexico City. My 17-yr old daughter had the misfortune to come in contact with Aeromar and the lack of services while she was on route to Acapulco, on December 23, 2017. She had two connecting flights with Aeromar Airlinesone which was delayed and caused her to missed her final flight to Acapulco. The flight that was delayed was Flight 522. This flight from Ixtapa, to Mexico City was delayed fourty minutes and therefore, she arrived late to her gate to board flight 907, to her final destination, which was Acapulco. She was denied boarding, and there was no help from anyone from Aeromar, after whoch was not permitted to board. My 17-yr old, started her holidays stranded in a foreign country, in a busy airport and just left to her demise. I tried contacting the airline, no one answered, I contact which tried to get in touch with costumer service, and the booking agent, was not able as well. What is disgusting, is that not a single of the airline personnel working that night, offered to help, my daughter was just turned away and you did not care, specially, since it was the airline's fault in the first place that she missed her flight. My daughter had a panic attack, was afraid, and I had to sort all this out from Canada. To my misfortune, I had to buy, yet another ticket from Aeromar, for the next day, as well as find accommodations for the night. The travel agency which helped me book this trip, has made numerous attempts to resolve this, and nothing has been resolved yet.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ixtapa Zihuatanejo to Acapulco via Mexico City,December 2017,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Aeromar,1,"""Incompetent and unfriendly""",4th January 2018,True," Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo to Mexico City. Once more a delayed flight, just three hours but without any guarantee. Just ""we hope that more or less at 4pm we will have a plane"". Incompetent and unfriendly staff, truly the bad side of Mexico, just the image the country does not want to give. Everybody here gives you the impression that they want you out of their face and expect you to be thankful that there might be a flight after all.
